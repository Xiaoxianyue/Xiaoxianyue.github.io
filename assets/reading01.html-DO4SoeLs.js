Cognitive fluidity explains the appearance of art, religion, and sophisticated speech. Once humans possessed such a mind, they were able to find an imaginative solution to a situation of severe economic crisis such as the farming dilemma described earlier. Mithen proposes the existence of four mental elements to account for the emergence of farming: (1) the ability to develop tools that could be used intensively to harvest and process plant resources; (2) the tendency to use plants and animals as the medium to acquire social prestige and power; (3) the tendency to develop &quot;social relationships&quot; with animals structurally similar to those developed with people—specifically, the ability to think of animals as people (anthropomorphism) and of people as animals (totemism); and (4) the tendency to manipulate plants and animals.</p><p>According to paragraph 5, Steven Mithen believes that all of the following contributed to the emergence of farming EXCEPT</p><p>A. the development of a mind flexible enough to come up with solutions to complex problems</p><p>B. the tendency to use plants and animals to acquire power</p><p>C. the tendency to emphasize the differences between animals and people</p><p>D. the ability to make tools that could be used for the large-scale harvesting of plants</p><p>选 C</p><blockquote><p>A 选项出现在第二排（不要只找递进部分哦！）</p></blockquote><p>In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater.
