Therefore, all the knowledge, skills, valuable experience in life accumulated in this (象牙塔) will make a great difference in the struggle for success of one person in future. To be more specific, university education is different from primary education that the key points of primary education most are in the most basic theories in the textbooks while the university offer opportunities that apply the knowledge one’s have learned in real life to students and lead the students to be (实事求是).

To illustrate, unlike <strong>preliminary education</strong> that emphasizes largely on the most fundamental theories in the textbooks, university education provides more opportunities for the students to put what has been learned into practice and guides them to seek truth from the facts. Tutors are allowing independent thinking and give their students more freedom to express personal opinions.

Ever since one&#39;s birth, his education has begun. Parents could be considered as the first teachers who render enlightening knowledge to their child. Later, formal education is received from the <strong>kindergarten</strong> and the primary school. During this period,teachers help children <strong>comprehend</strong> common sense and lead them to learn the most basic theories. As soon as a person arrives at the high school age, richer knowledge could be gained and more skills could be grasped. Doubtlessly, preliminary education prepares a person for the new stage of life in the university. Even when one graduates from the university, education is still to be continued <strong>at work</strong>. Just as the old saying goes, &quot;You&#39;re never too old to learn&quot;. As a result, not only university education, but also education in other periods, could be equally important factors that make a person succeed.</p><h4 id="_5-3-替换表达" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-3-替换表达"><span>5.3 替换表达</span></a></h4>',148)),a("ul",null,[e[5]||(e[5]=t("<li><p>**意义：**significance = mean</p></li><li><p><strong>process</strong> 作名词有：进程，过程，流程，程序的意思。这里着重强调教育是一直进行的一个东西，可以用 process 。</p></li><li><p><strong>possess</strong> 拥有，同义替换 have</p></li><li><p><strong>Ever since</strong>，自那时起；自从。后接完成时。可替换为 Since then；From that time on</p></li><li><p><strong>consider as</strong> = regard as = deem as</p></li>",5)),a("li",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("p",null,[a("strong",null,'"Render"'),r(" ：这里做提供的意思。同义词为 provide。render sth. to sb.")],-1)),p(o,{id:"895",data:[{id:"中文意思"},{id:"中文意思对应的同义词"}]},{title0:i(({value:s,isActive:n})=>e[0]||(e[0]=[r("中文意思")])),title1:i(({value:s,isActive:n})=>e[1]||(e[1]=[r("中文意思对应的同义词")])),tab0:i(({value:s,isActive:n})=>e[2]||(e[2]=[])),tab1:i(({value:s,isActive:n})=>e[3]||(e[3]=[])),_:1})]),e[6]||(e[6]=t("<li><p><strong>enlightening</strong>：“启蒙教育”</p><p>形容词：</p><ol><li>启发性的</li><li>使人领悟的</li><li>有教育意义的</li></ol></li><li><p><strong>comprehend：</strong></p><p>动词：</p><ol><li>理解</li><li>领会</li><li>包含</li><li>包括</li></ol></li><li><p><strong>常识</strong>：common sense</p></li><li><p>**到了该…的年纪：**arrive at the … age</p></li><li><p><strong>获得：</strong> <strong>acquire = gain = obtain</strong></p></li><li><p>junior school 一般不指中学，指小学或初中。</p></li><li><p><strong>preliminary：</strong></p><p>形容词：</p><ol><li>初步的</li><li>预备的</li><li>开端的</li><li>基础的</li></ol></li><li><p>**at work：**在工作时</p></li><li><p><strong>Just as an old saying goes:</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>后面接原因的词语：hence、so、consequently、as a result、therefore</strong></p></li>",10))]),e[8]||(e[8]=t('<h3 id="_6-第五段-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-第五段-1"><span>6. 第五段</span></a></h3><h4 id="_6-1-自翻-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-1-自翻-1"><span>6.1 自翻</span></a></h4><p>In one word==（没这个表达。改成In short）<mark>, having the opportunity to receive high</mark>er== education brings life with endless happiness==（bring endless happiness to life)<mark>, such <mark>a</mark> meaningful experiment pave the road</mark>(用 way 更恰当)== to one’s success.

Team work is constituted by (协作的） effort of the members of the team to reach the same goal. When the cooperation is bad, it is very hard for members to complete the assignments effectively, and usually struggle in (模糊的) goal. But as a team works like a good-operating machine, all members heart will connect with others. As a famous (歌词) going, “Combination is energy.” Indeed, team work is crucial for great success of any great career. Every member’s roles that (起指定作用) shall never be (轻视). Thus, to encourage team work, it is the most reasonable decision for the evaluator to give the same score to the whole group.</p><h4 id="他翻-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#他翻-1"><span>他翻</span></a></h4><p>In order to testify<mark>证实</mark> my standpoint, I would firstly place emphasis on the value of teamwork. Teamwork is a collaborative<mark>协作的</mark> effort by members of the group working together to achieve common<mark>共同的</mark> goals. When the teamwork breaks down, members of the team will find it is difficult to complete tasks effectively and often <mark>struggle with</mark> obscure<mark>模糊的，隐藏的，使模糊，使隐藏</mark> objective<mark>目标，客观的，公正的</mark>.

As is shown in the lyrics<mark>歌词</mark> of a famous song, “unity is paramount strength.” Truthfully, teamwork is essential to any success of any great <mark>cause</mark>. Each member plays an assigned part that should never be looked down upon. Thus giving the entire group the same grade is the most appropriate decision on part of the assessors to encourage teamwork.</p><h3 id="第三段" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#第三段"><span>第三段</span></a></h3><p>除此之外，分数的均等会增强小组成员的责任感。在某种程度上，使每个人都发挥作用有助于消除偏见与抵触情绪，而这些对项目的进展和结果都是有害的。正是这种共同的责任搭建起了团队的坚固基础。有了责任感，就能鼓舞每个成员的士气。我的教授曾经为一个重点研究项目做评判。已定的评分规则提倡给每位参与者打出不同的分数。令他失望的是，由于那些被分配到非核心任务的人失去了责任感和热情，这个项目最终未达到理想的目标。</p><h4 id="自翻-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#自翻-2"><span>自翻</span></a></h4><p>Except from this, the even grade will strength the responsibilities of members of groups.
