The height of a raised beach above the present shoreline, however, does not generally give a straightforward indication of the height of a former sea level. In the majority of cases, the beaches lie at a higher level because the land has been raised up through isostatic uplift or tectonic movements. <strong>Isostatic uplift</strong> of the land occurs when the weight of ice is removed as temperatures rise, as at the end of an ice age; it has affected coastlines, for example, in Scandinavia, Scotland, Alaska, and Newfoundland during the postglacial period.

The sediment settles out to form a nearly flat landform called a delta. Part of the delta lies above water level, and the remainder lies slightly below water level. Deltas are commonly fan-shaped, resembling the Greek letter “delta” (Δ). Both deltas and alluvial fans change rapidly. Sediment fills channels (waterways), which are then abandoned while new channels develop as in a braided stream. As a result, a stream feeding a delta or fan splits into many channels called distributaries. A large delta may spread out in this manner until it covers thousands of square kilometers. Most fans, however, are much smaller, covering a fraction of a square kilometer to a few square kilometers.

The idea of Brazilian independence first arose in the late eighteenth century as a Brazilian reaction to the Portuguese policy of tightening political and economic control over the colony in the interests of the mother country. The first significant conspiracy against Portuguese rule was organized from 1788–1799 in the province of Minas Gerais, where rigid governmental control over the production and prices of gold and diamonds, as well as heavy taxes, caused much discontent. But this conspiracy never went beyond the stage of discussion and was easily discovered and crushed. Other conspiracies in the late eighteenth century as well as a brief revolt in 1817 reflected the influence of republican ideas over sections of the elite and even the lower strata of urban society. All proved abortive or were soon crushed. Were it not for an accident of European history, the independence of Brazil might have been long delayed.</p><p>According to paragraph 1, what happened to the 1788–1799 conspiracy against Portuguese rule?</p><p>A.

As stars contracted, it was thought, they would get hotter and hotter, giving off light in the process. This could not be the primary way that stars shine, however. If it were, they would scarcely last a million years, rather than the billions of years in age that we know they are. We now know that stars are fueled by nuclear fusion. Each time fusion takes place, energy is released as a by-product. This energy, expelled into space, is what we see as starlight. The fusion process begins when two hydrogen nuclei smash together to form a particle called the deuteron (a combination of a positive proton and a neutral neutron). Deuterons readily combine with additional protons to form helium. Helium, in turn, can fuse together to form heavier elements, such as carbon. In a typical star, merger after merger takes place until significant quantities of heavy elements are built up.</p><p>According to paragraph 1, the energy that comes from stars and that is seen as light is the result of</p><p>A. protons combining with helium atoms</p><p>B. atoms of heavier elements smashing together</p><p>C. various particles fusing with one another</p><p>D. hydrogen atoms breaking apart</p><p>选 C</p><p><strong>A. protons combining with helium atoms</strong></p><ul><li>排除理由： <ul><li>文中提到质子与氘核（deuterons）结合形成氦，但并未提到质子与氦原子结合。此外，核聚变的主要过程是轻元素（如氢）逐渐聚变成较重元素，而非直接结合氦。</li><li>此选项描述错误，排除。</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>B. atoms of heavier elements smashing together</strong></p><ul><li>排除理由： <ul><li>核聚变的过程是从较轻的元素（如氢）开始逐渐形成较重的元素（如氦、碳），而不是重元素直接相互碰撞。这种情况通常在超新星爆炸中可能发生，而非正常恒星中。</li><li>此选项与文中核聚变的描述不符，排除。</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>D. hydrogen atoms breaking apart</strong></p><ul><li>排除理由： <ul><li>文中提到的是“氢原子核（nuclei）”结合，而非氢原子分裂。恒星的能量来源是核聚变而非核裂变，因此此选项与文意不符。</li><li>此选项错误，排除。</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="question-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#question-4"><span>Question 4</span></a></h4><p>One of the most significant evolutionary events that occurred on Earth was the transition of water-dwelling fish to terrestrial tetrapods (four-limbed organisms with backbones). Fish probably originated in the oceans。However, by the Devonian Period (408 million to 362 million years ago), they had radiated into almost all available aquatic habitats, including freshwater settings.
