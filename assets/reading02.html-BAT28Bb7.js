The intention is for the positively perceived attributes of the celebrity to be transferred to the advertised product and for the two to become automatically linked in the audience&#39;s mind. In children&#39;s advertising, the &quot;celebrities&quot; are often animated figures from popular cartoons. In the recent past, the role of celebrities in advertising to children has often been conflated with the concept of host selling. Host selling involves blending advertisements with regular programming in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other. <mark>Host selling occurs, for example, when a children&#39;s show about a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same lion promotes a breakfast cereal</mark>. The psychologist Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of host selling reduced children&#39;s ability to distinguish between advertising and program material. It was also found that older children responded more positively to products in host selling advertisements.</p><p>In paragraph 4, why does the author mention a show about a cartoon lion in which an advertisement appears featuring the same lion character?</p><p>A.

More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala. Modern irrigation devices, each capable of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a landscape dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. In addition, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef cattle are fattened here.</p><p>In paragraph 3, why does the author provide the information that 40 percent of American cattle are fattened in the High Plains?</p><p>A.

These rivers and river systems are known as &quot;exogenous&quot; because their sources lie outside the arid zone. They are vital for sustaining life in some of the driest parts of the world. For centuries, the annual floods of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, for example, have brought fertile silts（肥沃的淤泥） and water to the inhabitants of their lower valleys. <mark>Today, river discharges are increasingly controlled by human intervention, creating a need for international river-basin agreements</mark>.
