All these will definitely prove both expensive and time consuming. The situation could be challenging with many guests arriving.

Therefore, all the knowledge, skills, valuable experience in life accumulated in this (象牙塔) will make a great difference in the struggle for success of one person in future. To be more specific, university education is different from primary education that the key points of primary education most are in the most basic theories in the textbooks while the university offer opportunities that apply the knowledge one’s have learned in real life to students and lead the students to be (实事求是).

Thus, all the knowledge, skills <strong>along with</strong> the precious life experience accumulated inside this <strong>ivory tower</strong> would produce far-reaching influences on a person&#39;s future endeavors toward success. To illustrate, unlike <strong>preliminary education</strong> that emphasizes largely on the most fundamental theories in the textbooks, university education provides more opportunities for the students to put what has been learned into practice and guides them to seek truth from the facts. Tutors are allowing independent thinking and give their students more freedom to express personal opinions.
