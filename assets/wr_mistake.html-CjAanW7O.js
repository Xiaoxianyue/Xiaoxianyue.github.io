The reading material states that the site where the coin was found is very far away from the Norse settlements in North America, so it is impossible the coin is real. In contrast, the listening material presents an opposing view and says that there is a long distance between the site where other objects were found and the settlements. For instance, the native Americans maybe find and be interested in the coin during a travel and buy it which was brought back to the American&#39;s settlements. So that can fully explain the distance problem. Contrary to the reason that only one coin was discovered in the passage, the speaker contends that probably it&#39;s the Norse who needed to return to Europe for some reason and packed all coins up except the found one back to their home. According to the writing, the North Americans did not consider the silver coins as money, so the Norse have no reason to bring coins during their American journey. Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coin is not money to native Americans so as people nowadays, they are still valuable things that are beautiful, unusual and attractive to North Americans like other jewelry. Native Americans may want to trade silver coins with things that Norse were interested. So the money thing can not be a reason that Norse didn&#39;t bring coins to America.</p><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;The passage claims that a European silver coin that was discovered at a Native American archaeological site is a historical fake, while the lecture casts doubt on it.&quot;</p><p>分析：</p><ul><li><strong>“is a historical fake” 时态问题，应与“casts doubt on it”保持一致。</strong> 修改建议：</li><li><em>The passage claims that a European silver coin discovered at a Native American archaeological site <strong>was</strong> a historical fake, while the lecture casts doubt on it.</em></li></ul><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;The reading material states that the site where the coin was found is very far away from the Norse settlements in North America, so it is impossible the coin is real.&quot;</p><p>分析：</p><ul><li>“it is impossible the coin is real” 语法不完整，缺少连词或必要的结构。 修改建议：</li><li><em>...so it is impossible <strong>that</strong> the coin is real.</em></li></ul><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;For instance, the native Americans maybe find and be interested in the coin during a travel and buy it which was brought back to the American&#39;s settlements.&quot;</p><p>分析：</p><ul><li>“maybe find and be interested” 语法错误，“maybe” 应为 “may”，且动词形式混乱。</li><li>“during a travel” 不地道，应改为 “during travel” 或 “on a journey”。</li><li>“buy it which was brought back” 不连贯，建议拆分或调整结构。 <strong>修改建议：</strong></li><li><em>For instance, the Native Americans may have found and become interested in the coin during travel and bought it, bringing it back to their settlements.</em></li></ul><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;Contrary to the reason that only one coin was discovered in the passage, the speaker contends that probably it&#39;s the Norse who needed to return to Europe for some reason and packed all coins up except the found one back to their home.&quot;</p><p>分析：</p><ul><li>“Contrary to the reason” 用法不当，应为 “Contrary to the claim”。</li><li>“probably it&#39;s the Norse who needed to return” 冗长且结构不够正式，建议简化。</li><li>“packed all coins up except the found one back to their home” 句式不清晰，建议分解或调整顺序。 <strong>修改建议：</strong></li><li><em>Contrary to the claim that only one coin was discovered, the speaker contends that the Norse probably needed to return to Europe for some reason and took all the coins back with them, except for the one that was found.</em></li></ul><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;According to the writing, the North Americans did not consider the silver coins as money, so the Norse have no reason to bring coins during their American journey.&quot;</p><p>分析：</p><ul><li>“the Norse have no reason” 时态错误，应为过去时。</li><li>“did not consider the silver coins as money” 中 “as” 可省略，更简洁。 <strong>修改建议：</strong></li><li><em>According to the writing, the North Americans did not consider silver coins money, so the Norse had no reason to bring coins during their journey to America.</em></li></ul><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coin is not money to native Americans so as people nowadays, they are still valuable things that are beautiful, unusual and attractive to North Americans like other jewelry.&quot;</p><p>分析：</p><ul><li>“silver coin is not money to native Americans so as people nowadays” 结构混乱，应改为两个完整句子或重新组织句子。</li><li>“they are still valuable things that are beautiful, unusual and attractive” 冗长，建议简化为“they are still valuable, beautiful, and unusual”。 <strong>修改建议：</strong></li><li><em>Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coins were not considered money by Native Americans, just as they are not today, they were still valuable, beautiful, and unusual items attractive to Native Americans, similar to other forms of jewelry.</em></li></ul><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;Native Americans may want to trade silver coins with things that Norse were interested.&quot;</p><p>分析：</p><ul><li>“things that Norse were interested” 不完整，缺少介词。 <strong>修改建议：</strong></li><li><em>Native Americans may have wanted to trade silver coins for items that interested the Norse.</em></li></ul><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;So the money thing can not be a reason that Norse didn&#39;t bring coins to America.&quot;</p><p>分析：</p><ul><li>“money thing” 太口语化，不正式。</li><li>“can not” 应改为“cannot”。 <strong>修改建议：</strong></li><li><em>Thus, the issue of money cannot be a reason why the Norse did not bring coins to America.</em></li></ul><h2 id="off-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#off-37"><span>OFF 37</span></a></h2><p>The passage claims that using turtle excluder device(TED) is not a good idea for three reasons, while the lecture casts doubt on it.</p><p>First of all, the reading material states that the probability of turtles get caught is rarely, only one turtle trap in one shrimp boat&#39;s nets every month on average. Beside,shrimps may escape from the TEDs, which cause a loss to the shrimpers. In contrast, the listening material proposes an opposing view. Since a plenty of shrimp boats are operating nowadays, the number of turtles get trapped every year is a huge figure for an endangered specie. Although the single boat does not matter, but thousands of boats lead to great harm to the population of turtles. Also, we ought not to regard the TEDs as a loss for a single shrimper but think about that how the whole shrimp industry affect the whole turtles species.</p><p>Contrary to the belief that shortening the time limit that keeping the nets of boats underwater can rise the turtles to the surface of sea to breathe in time in the passage, the speaker contends that the way only works out on theory. It is difficult for government to enforce every single shrimp boats to obey the time limit. Since there are thousands of boats on the ocean, government patrol<mark>巡逻</mark> boats cannot really monitor the time limits all these boats use.

Moreover, it argues that shrimps may escape from the TEDs, causing a loss to shrimpers. In contrast, the listening material offers an opposing view. Since numerous shrimp boats are operating nowadays, the total number of turtles getting trapped annually represents a significant figure for an endangered species. While a single boat’s impact might seem negligible, the combined effect of thousands of boats poses a grave threat to the turtle population. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes that TEDs should not be viewed as a loss for individual shrimpers but rather as a necessary measure to prevent the shrimping industry as a whole from harming the entire turtle species.</p><p>Contrary to the belief in the passage that shortening the time nets are kept underwater can allow turtles to rise to the surface to breathe in time, the speaker contends that this method works only in theory. It is challenging for the government to ensure that every single shrimp boat adheres to the time limit. With thousands of boats on the ocean, government patrols cannot effectively monitor all the boats&#39; compliance. On the other hand, the government can easily enforce the use of TEDs by simply checking whether the nets are equipped with a TED before the boats leave the port.</p><p>Lastly, the passage argues that some large turtles cannot fit through the escape passage provided by TEDs. However, the listening material counters this by asserting that the size of TEDs can be adjusted in certain areas. For example, TEDs can be made larger where necessary, and altering the size does not affect the functionality of the device.</p><h2 id="off-47" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#off-47"><span>OFF 47</span></a></h2><p>The passage claims that Pterosaurs -- an ancient group of winged reptiles were not capable of powered flight, while the listening casts doubt on it. First of all, the reading material states that since the modern reptiles are cold-blooded, the ancients reptiles were probably also cold-blooded. Cold-blooded animals unlikely to create the energy need to fly. In contrast, the listening material presents an opposing view that some fossil from Pterosaurs shows the creature has a dense, hairlike covering which somewhat like fur. the fur, hair things symbolize that the Pterasaurs could be warm-blooded animals because only warm-blooded animals need fur to keep high body temperature in a cold circumstance. So they could supply the energy powered flight needed. Secondly, contrary to the belief that the Pterosaurs were too heavy to fly in the passage, the speakers contends that Pterosaurs had some features kept themselves light for their size. For instance, their bones were hollow instead of solid which decreased their wight and made them able to be airborn. Last but not least, according to the writing, the two back limbs of Pterasaurs were too weak and small to support Pterasaurs to run fast enough or jump high enough to fly. Conversely, the lecture refutes the standpoint. there are a significant difference between birds which use only two hind limbs to take off the ground and Pterasaurs which use all four limbs to take off the ground. Take bats for a example. The four limbs of bats are used to push off the ground, walk, jump and run. So the legs of bats do not need to be very strong or muscular and bats are also capable to jump high enough or run fast enough.</p><p><strong>1. 原句：</strong> &quot;The passage claims that Pterosaurs -- an ancient group of winged reptiles were not capable of powered flight, while the listening casts doubt on it.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;The passage claims that Pterosaurs, an ancient group of winged reptiles, were not capable of powered flight, while the listening casts doubt on this.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>2. 原句：</strong> &quot;Cold-blooded animals unlikely to create the energy need to fly.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;Cold-blooded animals are unlikely to generate the energy needed for flight.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>3. 原句：</strong> &quot;the creature has a dense, hairlike covering which somewhat like fur.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;the creature had a dense, hair-like covering <mark>similar to fur</mark>.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>4. 原句：</strong> &quot;symbolize that the Pterasaurs could be warm-blooded animals because only warm-blooded animals need fur to keep high body temperature in a cold circumstance.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;suggest that Pterosaurs could have been warm-blooded animals because only warm-blooded animals need fur to maintain a high body temperature <mark>in cold circumstances</mark>.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>5. 原句：</strong> &quot;could supply the energy powered flight needed.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;could have supplied the energy needed for powered flight.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>6. 原句：</strong> &quot;Secondly, contrary to the belief that the Pterosaurs were too heavy to fly in the passage, the speakers contends that Pterosaurs had some features kept themselves light for their size.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;Secondly, contrary to the belief that Pterosaurs were too heavy to fly in the passage, the speaker contends that Pterosaurs had features that kept <mark>them</mark> light for their size.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>7. 原句：</strong> &quot;For instance, their bones were hollow instead of solid which decreased their wight and made them able to be airborn.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;For instance, their bones were hollow rather than solid==,== which reduced their weight and <mark>enabled</mark> them <mark>to</mark> be <mark>airborne</mark>.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>8. 原句：</strong> &quot;Last but not least, according to the writing, the two back limbs of Pterasaurs were too weak and small to support Pterasaurs to run fast enough or jump high enough to fly.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;Last but not least, according to the reading, the two back limbs of Pterosaurs were too weak and small to <mark>support the Pterosaurs in</mark> running fast enough or jumping high enough to fly.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>9. 原句：</strong> &quot;Conversely, the lecture refutes the standpoint. there are a significant difference between birds which use only two hind limbs to take off the ground and Pterasaurs which use all four limbs to take off the ground.&quot;</p><p><strong>修改后：</strong> &quot;Conversely, the lecture refutes this view.
