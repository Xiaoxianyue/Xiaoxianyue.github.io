The reading material states that the site where the coin was found is very far away from the Norse settlements in North America, so it is impossible the coin is real. In contrast, the listening material presents an opposing view and says that there is a long distance between the site where other objects were found and the settlements. For instance, the native Americans maybe find and be interested in the coin during a travel and buy it which was brought back to the American&#39;s settlements. So that can fully explain the distance problem. Contrary to the reason that only one coin was discovered in the passage, the speaker contends that probably it&#39;s the Norse who needed to return to Europe for some reason and packed all coins up except the found one back to their home. According to the writing, the North Americans did not consider the silver coins as money, so the Norse have no reason to bring coins during their American journey. Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coin is not money to native Americans so as people nowadays, they are still valuable things that are beautiful, unusual and attractive to North Americans like other jewelry. Native Americans may want to trade silver coins with things that Norse were interested. So the money thing can not be a reason that Norse didn&#39;t bring coins to America.</p><hr><p>问题：</p><p>&quot;The passage claims that a European silver coin that was discovered at a Native American
