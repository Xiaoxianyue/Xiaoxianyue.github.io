- eat tart

前一个单词最后一个音节与后一个单词第一个音节是同一个辅音，只发一次。

- at all

前一个单词结尾的辅音与后一个单词开头第一个元音连读。上面的例子中，发 (艾套儿）自行脑补hhh。

#### 2. 单个单词发音

found

    ​                         VS

    B（动作/细节/行为/步骤/流程）+ 坏结果

    **B:**

    However, skipping one or two house chores like sweeping the floor doesn’t matter that much. Therefore, it has nothing to do with building the awareness of responsibility.

    

@tab 与其…还不如

- 结构：

    A: Instead of doing sth. (×)，which + 消极结果，

    B: sb. might as well do sth. (√)，+ 细节、原因、结果都可以



- e.g.

    **Question:**

    你更愿意在家参加线上面试或者去公司线下面试？

    **Question:**

    你是更愿意自己解决挑战还是寻求别人的帮助？

    **point:**

    depend on others’ help. Firstly, it is more time efficiency way of dealing with troubles. 

    **动作：**

    **结果:**

    ==As a result,== with help of group of people, problems always get solved very quickly for me. However, her efficiency, I heard, was nothing to `brag about`.

#### 1.3.7 好用的小 tips 或者逻辑结构

1. 当口语考试中需要对一些词进行同义替换，但一时之间又想不起来同义词怎么办？

**细节化。**

名词：

```
Graded assignments --> marked paper, scored report
a course --> marking, coding, law
course grade --> mark, score, A-F
```

动词：(这个是最不好细化的，最好找同义词或可以解释这个动词的词组)

```
allow --> permit, given second chance
do --> accomplish, finish, work on
improve --> enhance, raise, get a higher score
```

形容词：

```
graded --> marked, scored
additional --> extra, do some extracurricular activities, achieve the task that is not included in the syllabus
overall --> whole,conprehensive
```
