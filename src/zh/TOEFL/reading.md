## 1. 句子简化题

### 1.1 例题

#### Question 1

In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse, like huckleberry and vine maple, Arthur Einarsen, longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest, found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive.

A. Arthur Einarsen’s longtime family with the Pacific Northwest helped him discover areas where deer had an increase in suitable browse. 

B. Arthur Einarsen found that deforested feeding grounds provided deer with more and better food. 

C. Biologist like Einarsen believe it is important to find additional open areas with suitable browse for deer to inhabit. 

D. According to Einarsen, huckleberry and vine maple are examples of vegetation that may someday improve the nutrition of deer in the open areas of the Pacific Northwest.

#### Question 2

These have changed constantly through time, even in relatively recent periods, as can be seen from the Neolithic stone circle of Er Lannic, in Brittany, France (once inland but now half submerged on an island) or medieval villages in east Yorkshire, England, that have tumbled into the sea in the last few centuries as the North Sea gnaws its way westward and erodes the cliffs.

A. In the last few centuries, the erosion of coastline created the Neolithic stone circle in Brittany, France, at the same time that it destroyed the medieval villages in Yorkshire, England.

B. Coastlines have changed even in recent times as shown by the current locations of certain Neolithic monuments and medieval villages.

C. Recent changes in the coastlines near the Neolithic stone circle of Er Lannic in Brittany, France, and the medieval villages in Yorkshire, England, suggest that ancient coastlines changed in similar ways.

D. Changes in coastlines can lead to the creation of islands such as Er Lannic in France or the total erosion of the cliffs as in Yorkshire in England, though no considerable changes have occurred in recent periods.

#### B. 转折

**Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they seem to have been softened by the absence of steep hierarchies （陡峭的阶级/层次） of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women acquire most of the skills of men, including, often, their military skills.**

A. Despite the fact that wealth is relatively evenly distributed in pastoral societies, gender inequality still exists because only men can acquire military skills and social status.

B. Inequalities of gender existed in pastoralist societies until most communities began to require women to possess the same skills as men and take part in the military.

C. Inequalities of gender in pastoralist societies were caused by steep hierarchies of wealth and differences in military training between men and women.

D. In pastoral societies, gender inequality is comparatively mild because wealth is relatively evenly distributed and women have to learn most of the same skills that men do.

选 D



**In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose, architecture employs methods of support that, because they are based on physical laws, have changed little since people first discovered them—even while building materials have changed dramatically.**

A. Unchanging physical laws have limited the size and strength of buildings that can be made with materials discovered long ago.

B. Building materials have changed in order to increase architectural size and strength, but physical laws of structure have not changed.

C. When people first started to build, the structural methods used to provide strength and size were inadequate because they were not based on physical laws.

D. Unlike building materials, the methods of support used in architecture have not changed over time because they are based on physical laws.

**句子结构**

**But as more and more accumulations（积累，堆积） of strata（地层） were cataloged（编目） in more and more places, it became clear that the sequences of rocks sometimes differed from region to region and that no rock type was ever going to become a reliable time marker throughout the world.**

A. The discovery of regional differences in the sequences of rocks led geologists to believe that rock types could someday become reliable time markers.

B. Careful analysis of strata revealed that rocks cannot establish geological time because the pattern of rock layers varies from place to place.

C. Smith's catalogs of rock strata indicated that the sequences of rocks are different from place to place and from region to region.

D. Because people did not catalog regional differences in sequences of rocks, it was believed that rocks could never be reliable time markers.

Only the last of these was suited at all to the continuous operating of machines, and although waterpower abounded==丰富的== in Lancashire and Scotland and ran grain mills==谷物磨坊== as well as textile==织品== mills, it had one great disadvantage: streams flowed where nature intended them to, and water-driven factories had to be located on their banks whether or not the location was desirable for other reasons.

A. Running water was the best power source for factories since it could keep machines operating continuously, but since it was abundant only in Lancashire and Scotland, most mills and factories that were located elsewhere could not be water driven.

B. The disadvantage of using waterpower is that streams do not necessarily flow in places that are the most suitable for factories, which explains why so many water-powered grain and textile mills were located in undesirable places.

C. Since machines could be operated continuously only where running water was abundant, grain and textile mills, as well as other factories, tended to be located only in Lancashire and Scotland.

D. Running water was the only source of power that was suitable for the continuous operation of machines, but to make use of it, factories had to be located where the water was, regardless of whether such locations made sense otherwise.

A选项：

> **Running water was the best power source for factories since it could keep machines operating continuously, but since it was abundant only in Lancashire and Scotland, most mills and factories that were located elsewhere could not be water driven.**

**错误点**：

- 强调水力发电仅限于 Lancashire 和 Scotland，但题干没有提到“其他地方的工厂无法使用水力”的限制，而是讨论了“水力工厂必须建在不理想的地方”这一点。
- 偏离了题干对水力“缺陷”的具体讨论。

------

C选项：

> **Since machines could be operated continuously only where running water was abundant, grain and textile mills, as well as other factories, tended to be located only in Lancashire and Scotland.**

**错误点**：

- 将“工厂集中在 Lancashire 和 Scotland”作为主要结果，而题干并未如此限定。题干关注的是水力工厂选址受限于水流位置（自然决定），并未强调地理区域的集中性。
- 逻辑推断偏离了题干的核心讨论。

------

D选项：

> **Running water was the only source of power that was suitable for the continuous operation of machines, but to make use of it, factories had to be located where the water was, regardless of whether such locations made sense otherwise.**

**错误点**：

- 强调“水力是唯一适合的动力来源”（the only source of power），与题干逻辑不符。题干只是指出“水力存在缺陷”，而非说明它是唯一可行的能源。
- 包含事实偏离，题干并未否认其他动力来源的存在。

One of the most important changes in Greece during the period from 800 B.C. to 500 B.C. was the rise of the polis, or city-state, and each polis developed a system of government that was appropriate to its circumstances. The problems that were faced and solved in Athens were the sharing of political power between the established aristocracy and the emerging other classes, and the adjustment of aristocratic ways of life to the ways of life of the new polis. It was the harmonious blending of all of these elements that was to produce the classical culture of Athens

Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about the Greek city-states?

A. Most city-states followed the model provided by Athens.

B. Most city-states were based on aristocratic rule.

C. Different types of government and organization were used by different city-states.

D. By 500 B.C. the city-states were no longer powerful.

**Greek city-states** 快速定位到第一排最后一个词。‘polis, or city-state, and each polis developed a system of government that was appropriate to its circumstances.’ polis 就是 city-states 的意思。



The assessment of past rises and falls in sea level requires study of submerged land surfaces off the coast and of raised or elevated beaches on land. Raised beaches are remnants of former coastlines at higher levels relative to the present shoreline and visible, for instance, along the Californian coast north of San Francisco. The height of a raised beach above the present shoreline, however, does not generally give a straightforward indication of the height of a former sea level. In the majority of cases, the beaches lie at a higher level because the land has been raised up through isostatic uplift or tectonic movements. **Isostatic uplift** of the land occurs when the weight of ice is removed as temperatures rise, as at the end of an ice age; it has affected coastlines, for example, in Scandinavia, Scotland, Alaska, and Newfoundland during the postglacial period. Tectonic movements involve displacements in the plates that make up Earth’s crust; Middle and Late Pleistocene raised beaches in the Mediterranean are one instance of such movements.

According to paragraph 3, which of the following causes an isostatic uplift?

A.   Shifts in Earth’s crust

B.   A decrease in the pressure of thick ice sheets  √

C.   A decrease in temperature

D.   Changes in sea level

A stream also slows abruptly where it enters the still water of a lake or ocean. The sediment settles out to form a nearly flat landform called a delta. Part of the delta lies above water level, and the remainder lies slightly below water level. Deltas are commonly fan-shaped, resembling the Greek letter “delta” (Δ). Both deltas and alluvial fans change rapidly. Sediment fills channels (waterways), which are then abandoned while new channels develop as in a braided stream. As a result, a stream feeding a delta or fan splits into many channels called distributaries. A large delta may spread out in this manner until it covers thousands of square kilometers. Most fans, however, are much smaller, covering a fraction of a square kilometer to a few square kilometers. The Mississippi River has flowed through seven different delta channels during the past 5,000 to 6,000 years. But in recent years, engineers have built great systems of levees (retaining walls) in attempts to stabilize the channels.

According to paragraph 4, what is true about river deltas

A.   They alternate between periods of spreading out and periods of getting smaller.

B.   They have both active channels and channels that have been blocked by sediment.

C.   They are typically formed by rivers that are braided before they reach the delta area.

D.   They are much larger when formed in a still lake than when formed in the ocean.

选 B

“Sediment fills channels (waterways), which are then abandoned while new channels develop as in a braided stream.”

### 2.3 同义改写

#### Question 1

In contrast to the political anarchy, economic dislocation, and military destruction in Spanish America, Brazil’s drive toward independence from Portugal proceeded as a relatively bloodless transition between 1808 and 1822. The idea of Brazilian independence first arose in the late eighteenth century as a Brazilian reaction to the Portuguese policy of tightening political and economic control over the colony in the interests of the mother country. The first significant conspiracy against Portuguese rule was organized from 1788–1799 in the province of Minas Gerais, where rigid governmental control over the production and prices of gold and diamonds, as well as heavy taxes, caused much discontent. But this conspiracy never went beyond the stage of discussion and was easily discovered and crushed. Other conspiracies in the late eighteenth century as well as a brief revolt in 1817 reflected the influence of republican ideas over sections of the elite and even the lower strata of urban society. All proved abortive or were soon crushed. Were it not for an accident of European history, the independence of Brazil might have been long delayed.

According to paragraph 1, what happened to the 1788–1799 conspiracy against Portuguese rule?

A. It ended up creating discontent in certain provinces of Brazil.

B. It increasingly came under the influence of republican ideas from Portugal.

C. It was crushed before it got beyond the planning stage.

D. It gradually lost the support of the lower strata of urban society.

选 C

**对应的文中语义**：

- 原文中提到：

    > "But this conspiracy never went beyond the stage of discussion and was easily discovered and crushed."

**同义替换解析**：

- "never went beyond the stage of discussion"

     被替换为 

    "before it got beyond the planning stage"：

    - 原文中的 "discussion stage" 对应选项中的 "planning stage"，两者表达相同的意思，即该阴谋从未进入具体行动阶段。

- "was easily discovered and crushed"

     被直接保留为 

    "It was crushed"：

    - 两者直接一致，明确表明阴谋失败且被镇压。





#### Question 2

Play is easier to define with examples than with concepts. In any case, in animals it consists of leaping, running, climbing, throwing, wrestling, and other movements, either along, with objects, or with other animals. Depending on the species, play may be primarily for social interaction, exercise, or exploration. One of the problems in providing a clear definition of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstance--dominance, predation, competition, and real fighting. Thus, whether play occurs or not depends on the intention of the animals, and the intentions are not always clear from behaviors alone.

According to paragraph 1, why is play difficult to define?

A. Play must be defined with concepts, not examples.

B. Play behavior often looks like nonplay behavior

C. Play often occurs in the presence of animals that are not playing

D. Play occurs independently of an animal’s intentions

选 B 

::: warning 为啥？

> "One of the problems in providing a clear definition of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstances—dominance, predation, competition, and real fighting."

#### Question 3

Until the early- to mid-twentieth century, scientists believed that stars generate energy by shrinking. As stars contracted, it was thought, they would get hotter and hotter, giving off light in the process. This could not be the primary way that stars shine, however. If it were, they would scarcely last a million years, rather than the billions of years in age that we know they are. We now know that stars are fueled by nuclear fusion. Each time fusion takes place, energy is released as a by-product. This energy, expelled into space, is what we see as starlight. The fusion process begins when two hydrogen nuclei smash together to form a particle called the deuteron (a combination of a positive proton and a neutral neutron). Deuterons readily combine with additional protons to form helium. Helium, in turn, can fuse together to form heavier elements, such as carbon. In a typical star, merger after merger takes place until significant quantities of heavy elements are built up.

According to paragraph 1, the energy that comes from stars and that is seen as light is the result of

A. protons combining with helium atoms

B. atoms of heavier elements smashing together

C. various particles fusing with one another

D. hydrogen atoms breaking apart

选 C

**A. protons combining with helium atoms**

- 排除理由：
    - 文中提到质子与氘核（deuterons）结合形成氦，但并未提到质子与氦原子结合。此外，核聚变的主要过程是轻元素（如氢）逐渐聚变成较重元素，而非直接结合氦。
    - 此选项描述错误，排除。

**B. atoms of heavier elements smashing together**

- 排除理由：
    - 核聚变的过程是从较轻的元素（如氢）开始逐渐形成较重的元素（如氦、碳），而不是重元素直接相互碰撞。这种情况通常在超新星爆炸中可能发生，而非正常恒星中。
    - 此选项与文中核聚变的描述不符，排除。

**D. hydrogen atoms breaking apart**

- 排除理由：
    - 文中提到的是“氢原子核（nuclei）”结合，而非氢原子分裂。恒星的能量来源是核聚变而非核裂变，因此此选项与文意不符。
    - 此选项错误，排除。



#### Question 4

One of the most significant evolutionary events that occurred on Earth was the transition of water-dwelling fish to terrestrial tetrapods (four-limbed organisms with backbones). Fish probably originated in the oceans。However, by the Devonian Period (408 million to 362 million years ago), they had radiated into almost all available aquatic habitats, including freshwater settings. One of the groups whose fossils are especially common in rocks deposited in fresh water is the lobe-finned fish.

Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about fish evolution?

A. Lobe-finned fish were among the earliest types of fish to appear.

B. Fish began living in freshwater habitats only after originating elsewhere.

C. Lobe-finned fish radiated into almost all available aquatic habitats.

D. During the Devonian, lobe-finned fish were more common in marine than in freshwater habitats.

**其实每个选项都有一定问题，选一个问题最小的**

2. **B. Fish began living in freshwater habitats only after originating elsewhere.**
    - 排除理由：
        - 文中确实提到鱼类“probably originated in the oceans”（可能起源于海洋），但没有明确说鱼类在起源后“仅仅后来”才进入淡水栖息地。选项 B 的表述过于绝对，缺乏支持。
3. **D. During the Devonian, lobe-finned fish were more common in marine than in freshwater habitats.**
    - 排除理由：
        - 文中并未比较叶鳍鱼在海洋和淡水栖息地中的数量或分布比例，只提到它们扩散到淡水栖息地。
