#### Question 1

In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse, like huckleberry and vine maple, Arthur Einarsen, longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest, found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive.

A. Arthur Einarsen’s longtime family with the Pacific Northwest helped him discover areas where deer had an increase in suitable browse. 

B. Arthur Einarsen found that deforested feeding grounds provided deer with more and better food. 

C. Biologist like Einarsen believe it is important to find additional open areas with suitable browse for deer to inhabit. 

D. According to Einarsen, huckleberry and vine maple are examples of vegetation that may someday improve the nutrition of deer in the open areas of the Pacific Northwest.

::: info 解题

1. **抓住题干的核心信息**

题干的核心信息是：

- **发现开阔区域的植被（如越橘和藤枫）更有营养**。
- 主语是**Arthur Einarsen**，背景是**太平洋西北地区的长期野生生物学家**。

关键动词是“发现”（found），宾语是“开阔区域的植被更有营养”（the quality of browse in open areas to be substantially more nutritive）。

2. **排除无关选项**

- **A**：提到他的家庭帮助发现适合鹿的区域，但与题干无关，因为题干没有提到“家庭”。
- **B**：提到砍伐的区域为鹿提供更好食物，这是对题干内容的过度引申，原文未提到“砍伐区域”。
- **C**：提到找到更多开阔区域的重要性，但题干没有讨论行动的重要性或目标。
- **D**：准确提到越橘和藤枫是开阔区域营养植被的例子，与题干内容一致。

3. **选出与题干同义改写最接近的选项**

**D选项**直接提到“越橘和藤枫可能改善鹿的营养”，这与原文信息一致。

4. **总结解题技巧**

- **第一步：抓住句子核心（主语+动词+宾语）**。
- **第二步：分析选项的关键信息是否与题干匹配**，去掉偏离或引申过多的选项。
- **第三步：优先选择简洁直接的表达**，避免过度解释。

#### Question 2

These have changed constantly through time, even in relatively recent periods, as can be seen from the Neolithic stone circle of Er Lannic, in Brittany, France (once inland but now half submerged on an island) or medieval villages in east Yorkshire, England, that have tumbled into the sea in the last few centuries as the North Sea gnaws its way westward and erodes the cliffs.

A. In the last few centuries, the erosion of coastline created the Neolithic stone circle in Brittany, France, at the same time that it destroyed the medieval villages in Yorkshire, England.

B. Coastlines have changed even in recent times as shown by the current locations of certain Neolithic monuments and medieval villages.

C. Recent changes in the coastlines near the Neolithic stone circle of Er Lannic in Brittany, France, and the medieval villages in Yorkshire, England, suggest that ancient coastlines changed in similar ways.

D. Changes in coastlines can lead to the creation of islands such as Er Lannic in France or the total erosion of the cliffs as in Yorkshire in England, though no considerable changes have occurred in recent periods.

### 1.2 句间关系

#### A. 因果

1. **Because the medium was so prolific（多产的）, in the sense that it was possible to produce a multitude of images very cheaply, it was soon treated as the poor relation of fine art, rather than its destined successor（继承者）**.

#### B. 转折

**Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they seem to have been softened by the absence of steep hierarchies （陡峭的阶级/层次） of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women acquire most of the skills of men, including, often, their military skills.**

**But as more and more accumulations（积累，堆积） of strata（地层） were cataloged（编目） in more and more places, it became clear that the sequences of rocks sometimes differed from region to region and that no rock type was ever going to become a reliable time marker throughout the world.**

A. The discovery of regional differences in the sequences of rocks led geologists to believe that rock types could someday become reliable time markers.

B. Careful analysis of strata revealed that rocks cannot establish geological time because the pattern of rock layers varies from place to place.

D. Because people did not catalog regional differences in sequences of rocks, it was believed that rocks could never be reliable time markers.
