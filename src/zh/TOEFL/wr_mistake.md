## OFF 44

The passage claims that a European silver coin that was discovered at a Native American archaeological site is a historical fake, while the lecture casts doubt on it.
The reading material states that the site where the coin was found is very far away from the Norse settlements in North America, so it is impossible the coin is real. In contrast, the listening material presents an opposing view and says that there is a long distance between the site where other objects were found and the settlements. For instance, the native Americans maybe find and be interested in the coin during a travel and buy it which was brought back to the American's settlements. So that can fully explain the distance problem.
Contrary to the reason that only one coin was discovered in the passage, the speaker contends that probably it's the Norse who needed to return to Europe for some reason and packed all coins up except the found one back to their home.
According to the writing, the North Americans did not consider the silver coins as money, so the Norse have no reason to bring coins during their American journey. Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coin is not money to native Americans so as people nowadays, they are still valuable things that are beautiful, unusual and attractive to North Americans like other jewelry. Native Americans may want to trade silver coins with things that Norse were interested. So the money thing can not be a reason that Norse didn't bring coins to America.

     **修改建议：**
- *Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coins were not considered money by Native Americans, just as they are not today, they were still valuable, beautiful, and unusual items attractive to Native Americans, similar to other forms of jewelry.*

"Native Americans may want to trade silver coins with things that Norse were interested."

分析：

- “things that Norse were interested” 不完整，缺少介词。
     **修改建议：**
- *Native Americans may have wanted to trade silver coins for items that interested the Norse.*

------

问题：

"So the money thing can not be a reason that Norse didn't bring coins to America."

分析：

- “money thing” 太口语化，不正式。
- “can not” 应改为“cannot”。
     **修改建议：**
- *Thus, the issue of money cannot be a reason why the Norse did not bring coins to America.*





## OFF 37

The passage claims that using turtle excluder device(TED) is not a good idea for three reasons, while the lecture casts doubt on it.

First of all, the reading material states that the probability of turtles get caught is rarely, only one turtle trap in one shrimp boat's nets every month on average. Beside,shrimps may escape from the TEDs, which cause a loss to the shrimpers. In contrast, the listening material proposes an opposing view. Since a plenty of shrimp boats are operating nowadays, the number of turtles get trapped every year is a huge figure for an endangered specie. Although the single boat does not matter, but thousands of boats lead to great harm to the population of turtles. Also, we ought not to regard the TEDs as a loss for a single shrimper but think about that how the whole shrimp industry affect the whole turtles species.

Contrary to the belief that shortening the time limit that keeping the nets of boats underwater can rise the turtles to the surface of sea to breathe in time in the passage, the speaker contends that the way only works out on theory. It is difficult for government to enforce every single shrimp boats to obey the time limit. Since there are thousands of boats on the ocean, government patrol==巡逻== boats cannot really monitor the time limits all these boats use. Conversely, the government can easily manage shrimping using TEDs, which just need to check whether the nets have a TED on it before boats leave port==港口==.

Last but not least, according to the writing, some big turtles cannot fit through the escape passage that the TEDs offer. However, the listening asserts that the size of TEDs can be adjusted in certain areas. TEDs should be larger in somewhere and change the size doesn’t effect TEDs’ other functions.

**语法错误修正**：

- "the probability of turtles get caught" → "the probability of turtles getting caught"。
- "which cause a loss to the shrimpers" → "causing a loss to shrimpers"。
- "how the whole shrimp industry affect" → "how the whole shrimp industry affects"。
- "change the size doesn’t effect" → "changing the size does not affect"。

**表达优化**：

- "only one turtle trap" → "only one turtle being trapped"。
- "the number of turtles get trapped every year is a huge figure" → "the total number of turtles getting trapped ==annually== represents a significant figure"。
- "we ought not to regard the TEDs as a loss for a single shrimper" → "TEDs should not be viewed as a loss for individual shrimpers"。
- "the way only works out on theory" → "==this method works only in theory=="。

**修正版**

The passage claims that using a turtle excluder device (TED) is not a good idea for three reasons, while the lecture casts doubt on this argument.

First of all, the reading material states that the probability of turtles getting caught is low, with only one turtle being trapped in one shrimp boat’s nets per month on average. Moreover, it argues that shrimps may escape from the TEDs, causing a loss to shrimpers. In contrast, the listening material offers an opposing view. Since numerous shrimp boats are operating nowadays, the total number of turtles getting trapped annually represents a significant figure for an endangered species. While a single boat’s impact might seem negligible, the combined effect of thousands of boats poses a grave threat to the turtle population. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes that TEDs should not be viewed as a loss for individual shrimpers but rather as a necessary measure to prevent the shrimping industry as a whole from harming the entire turtle species.

Contrary to the belief in the passage that shortening the time nets are kept underwater can allow turtles to rise to the surface to breathe in time, the speaker contends that this method works only in theory. It is challenging for the government to ensure that every single shrimp boat adheres to the time limit. With thousands of boats on the ocean, government patrols cannot effectively monitor all the boats' compliance. On the other hand, the government can easily enforce the use of TEDs by simply checking whether the nets are equipped with a TED before the boats leave the port.

Lastly, the passage argues that some large turtles cannot fit through the escape passage provided by TEDs. However, the listening material counters this by asserting that the size of TEDs can be adjusted in certain areas. For example, TEDs can be made larger where necessary, and altering the size does not affect the functionality of the device.

The passage claims that Pterosaurs -- an ancient group of winged reptiles were not capable of powered flight, while the listening casts doubt on it.
First of all, the reading material states that since the modern reptiles are cold-blooded, the ancients reptiles were probably also cold-blooded. Cold-blooded animals unlikely to create the energy need to fly. In contrast, the listening material presents an opposing view that some fossil from Pterosaurs shows the creature has a dense, hairlike covering which somewhat like fur. the fur, hair things symbolize that the Pterasaurs could be warm-blooded animals because only warm-blooded animals need fur to keep high body temperature in a cold circumstance. So they could supply the energy powered flight needed.
Secondly, contrary to the belief that the Pterosaurs were too heavy to fly in the passage, the speakers contends that Pterosaurs had some features kept themselves light for their size. For instance, their bones were hollow instead of solid which decreased their wight and made them able to be airborn.
Last but not least, according to the writing, the two back limbs of Pterasaurs were too weak and small to support Pterasaurs to run fast enough or jump high enough to fly. Conversely, the lecture refutes the standpoint. there are a significant difference between birds which use only two hind limbs to take off the ground and Pterasaurs which use all four limbs to take off the ground. Take bats for a example. The four limbs of bats are used to push off the ground, walk, jump and run. So the legs of bats do not need to be very strong or muscular and bats are also capable to jump high enough or run fast enough.

## Off 54 Task 2

### 原文

I disagree with the statement for two reasons. In the first place, increasing the money to support arts is not enough. Not only does the thriving of arts need money, but also a better cultural condition and education of the nation play an important role, which would take many years to form and systematize with persistent diligence. Besides, giving financial support to athletics is significantly efficient. The money could be used on good professional sports equipment to guarantee the athletes are trained in an appropriate and advanced way. And also Olympic game is a perfect approach to show the perseverance and iron determination of a country to the world, which deserves wholehearted attentiveness on the part of the government. A great Olympic team will be a pride of a nation, and the victory of the team is an inspirational moral.

### 改进版

I disagree with the statement for two reasons. In the first place, while increasing financial support for the arts is essential, it is not sufficient on its own. The flourishing of arts requires not only funding but also a strong cultural foundation and widespread education among the population, both of which take years of consistent effort to develop. 

On the other hand, allocating financial resources to athletics is highly impactful. The money can be invested in advanced sports equipment and facilities, ensuring that athletes receive proper training to achieve excellence. Moreover, the Olympic Games provide a unique platform to showcase a nation’s perseverance and determination to the world, reflecting its collective strength and unity. A successful Olympic team becomes a source of pride for the entire nation.

I agree with the idea for two reasons. Firstly, as is vastly acknowledged, making decisions independently is an essential ability in adults' world. Before children go to the college, the problems they should deal with are not very serious like picking a subject to learn and so on. The parents should understand that children ought to make small decisions on their own to cultivate the ability of facing important choices. Small decision means smaller responsibility if making the wrong choice, so parents could not be worry about their kids. Secondly, the world around us has significantly changed and is different from the generation of the parents. Although parents have more experience, making decision for their children who live in a total different society might not be a wise choice. To some degree, parents also might have some prejudice for their children's generation, which may increase the undesirable mood between children and parents when parents try to make decisions for their kids.

## Off 38 Task 1

In==去掉In，拜托了哪里来的In== The passage claims 3 ways to protect the forests from being damaged by P.ramorum, while the lecture casts doubt on all of them.
In the first place, the reading material states that encouraging people to cleaning ==clean== their shoes or bicycle trails that may carry spores of P. ramorum would be an effective and low-cost way. On the other hand, the listening material presents an opposing view. Spores are not just carried by human-being, but also carried by water such as rainfall and stream, which make it harder to stop spores' spreading.
Besides, the writer makes the point that using fungicidal chemicals is another way to help oak trees to ==help后面不需要加to，直接用动词原型== defend themselves. Conversely, the speaker demonstrates a different idea. Fungicidal chemicals is ==are== useful when they are injected directly to ==into== the trees' trunks, which means it is very expensive and impractical to use the ==this== approach to deal with the P. ramorum problem in large forests. Also, the injection should ==be== repeat==ed== every month, so this way only can ==can和only的位置交换== be used in a small group of trees like trees around the cities.
Finally, contrary to the author’s belief that P. ramorum problem can be solved by cleaning up diseased oak trees and vegetation surrounding them, the lecturer says that some vegetation around silk trees are actually health==y==. Therefore, cutting down them is unfair. What's more, some plants nearby ==near== the oak trees are very rare and not easy to grow back again==去掉==, so the cleaning up method would cause bigger and more serious problems than the original one.

I disagree with the ==this== statement for two reasons. The first reason is because ==that== there are always people with leadership around us.

They can watch the ways ==methods== or skills the leader used to solve some problems, and that is definitely helpful to follow ==in following== the pattern.
