## OFF 44

The passage claims that a European silver coin that was discovered at a Native American archaeological site is a historical fake, while the lecture casts doubt on it.
The reading material states that the site where the coin was found is very far away from the Norse settlements in North America, so it is impossible the coin is real. In contrast, the listening material presents an opposing view and says that there is a long distance between the site where other objects were found and the settlements. For instance, the native Americans maybe find and be interested in the coin during a travel and buy it which was brought back to the American's settlements. So that can fully explain the distance problem.
Contrary to the reason that only one coin was discovered in the passage, the speaker contends that probably it's the Norse who needed to return to Europe for some reason and packed all coins up except the found one back to their home.
According to the writing, the North Americans did not consider the silver coins as money, so the Norse have no reason to bring coins during their American journey. Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coin is not money to native Americans so as people nowadays, they are still valuable things that are beautiful, unusual and attractive to North Americans like other jewelry. Native Americans may want to trade silver coins with things that Norse were interested. So the money thing can not be a reason that Norse didn't bring coins to America.

     修改建议：
- *The passage claims that a European silver coin discovered at a Native American archaeological site **was** a historical fake, while the lecture casts doubt on it.*

------

问题：

"The reading material states that the site where the coin was found is very far away from the Norse settlements in North America, so it is impossible the coin is real."

分析：

- “it is impossible the coin is real” 语法不完整，缺少连词或必要的结构。
     修改建议：
- *...so it is impossible **that** the coin is real.*

------

问题：

"For instance, the native Americans maybe find and be interested in the coin during a travel and buy it which was brought back to the American's settlements."

分析：

- “maybe find and be interested” 语法错误，“maybe” 应为 “may”，且动词形式混乱。
- “during a travel” 不地道，应改为 “during travel” 或 “on a journey”。
- “buy it which was brought back” 不连贯，建议拆分或调整结构。
     **修改建议：**
- *For instance, the Native Americans may have found and become interested in the coin during travel and bought it, bringing it back to their settlements.*

------

问题：

"Contrary to the reason that only one coin was discovered in the passage, the speaker contends that probably it's the Norse who needed to return to Europe for some reason and packed all coins up except the found one back to their home."

分析：

- “Contrary to the reason” 用法不当，应为 “Contrary to the claim”。
- “probably it's the Norse who needed to return” 冗长且结构不够正式，建议简化。
- “packed all coins up except the found one back to their home” 句式不清晰，建议分解或调整顺序。
     **修改建议：**
- *Contrary to the claim that only one coin was discovered, the speaker contends that the Norse probably needed to return to Europe for some reason and took all the coins back with them, except for the one that was found.*

------

问题：

"According to the writing, the North Americans did not consider the silver coins as money, so the Norse have no reason to bring coins during their American journey."

分析：

- “the Norse have no reason” 时态错误，应为过去时。
- “did not consider the silver coins as money” 中 “as” 可省略，更简洁。
     **修改建议：**
- *According to the writing, the North Americans did not consider silver coins money, so the Norse had no reason to bring coins during their journey to America.*

------

问题：

"Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coin is not money to native Americans so as people nowadays, they are still valuable things that are beautiful, unusual and attractive to North Americans like other jewelry."

分析：

- “silver coin is not money to native Americans so as people nowadays” 结构混乱，应改为两个完整句子或重新组织句子。
- “they are still valuable things that are beautiful, unusual and attractive” 冗长，建议简化为“they are still valuable, beautiful, and unusual”。
     **修改建议：**
- *Conversely, the speaker refutes this standpoint presented by the writer, asserting that although silver coins were not considered money by Native Americans, just as they are not today, they were still valuable, beautiful, and unusual items attractive to Native Americans, similar to other forms of jewelry.*

------

问题：

"Native Americans may want to trade silver coins with things that Norse were interested."

分析：

- “things that Norse were interested” 不完整，缺少介词。
     **修改建议：**
- *Native Americans may have wanted to trade silver coins for items that interested the Norse.*

------

问题：

"So the money thing can not be a reason that Norse didn't bring coins to America."

分析：

- “money thing” 太口语化，不正式。
- “can not” 应改为“cannot”。
     **修改建议：**
- *Thus, the issue of money cannot be a reason why the Norse did not bring coins to America.*
