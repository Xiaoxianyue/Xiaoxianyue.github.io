I totally agree with the idea of Claire. Although Kelly’s words make sense [in some degree]==to some extent==, but parks and green plants are [actually]==just== as essential  as the other buildings such as supermarkets[ to human-being]==for human beings==. Claire’s statements [provide]==offer== a new way to solve this problem for us.

Creating green spaces on [the] top of the buildings can [give]==provide== more space [to the building like]==for== the  hospital==s== and clinics, whilst people in the city can breath==e== fresh air. I personally suggest that there ought to be a==n== open area [in]==on== the every floors of those building to grow plants instead of just on the [top of the buildings]==rooftop==. In that case, people ==can== not only [can] [receive]==enjoy== the convenience but also [can enjoy]==appreciate== the bea==u==ty of the natural [even]==when== they are in cities.

In my opinion, if city governments have to choose between using a piece of land as “green space” or developing it for other uses, they should always choose the latter. Kelly made a great point: “It is more important to use the space for things people cannot survive without.” Green spaces are indeed pleasing to look at, but they provide little other than aesthetic value. 

On the other hand, hospitals and clinics can really save lives. I think this issue really boils down to the standard we choose in these situations. Do we put utility and the actual needs of the people first, or do we prioritize having “nice things”? In reality, this is not really much of a debate. Let’s consider for a second what would happen if we always chose aesthetics over utility. We would end up with a botanical garden full of exotic flora, while people have to wait for months for a proper checkup. People would be waiting in line for hours at a supermarket or grocery store because all the land was being converted into parks. This is quite an absurd picture.

I totally agree with Kelly’s words. Although Claire’s [words]==points== make sense, but some people might not want to develop agriculture in the rural area. Some [of them]==individuals==  such as a doctor or an engineer may have some professional and specialized skills and hope that their knowledge could give a help to the rural [people]==population==. In that case, [a rural area]==rural areas== is also going to be more convenient for people [who live in there]==living there==.

Moreover, ==the presence of== more places like shops, restaurants and hospital==s== [provide]==creates== more job opportunities, which attract a [huge quantities]==large number== of young people who just graduated form colleges but cannot find a job in the city. In [that case]==this way==, young people can bring a more fashion==able== atmosphere [in]==to== [the] rural area. And more entertainment and cultural [places]==venues add now energy to the villages.

I believe that if the government wants to contribute to rural development, the best strategy is to encourage the development of various forms of business and industry in rural areas, just like Kelly said. One major benefit of promoting innovation in business is that it can open up new possibilities and develop new business models. Traditionally, farmers had limited options in their livelihoods: they usually relied solely on their crops and agricultural produce, without knowing how to market their products. This puts many small-scale farmers at a disadvantage, as is the case in today’s rapidly changing market. Farmers who do not adapt may fall behind and struggle to make a decent income. However, if the government supports initiatives that encourage innovation involving technology and social media, there can be room for economic growth. 

Some may argue that other measures like providing direct financial support can solve the problem of low pay for farmers and boost the local economy, but there is a critical factor that goes unnoticed: sustainability. While such a policy may provide short-term benefits, it does not address the root problem in the long run. As the cost of living is rising globally, government subsidies may fail to meet growing expenses at some point in the future.

I totally agree with the Kelly’s words for two main reasons.

The most fair reflection of whether the students have grasped the knowledge well is the grades of the students. [Students spend]==spending== more diligence and time on their academical work does not ==necessarily== mean that those students have a better understanding. Every [students]==student== have their own study [stragedy]==strategy==, teachers cannot judge the learning pattern==s== of the students. Besides, the students ==who== [take]==spend== [little]==less== time [to study]==studying== may have a strong fundamental of the certain knowledge, which they [previously learned them hardily.]==they have learned previously with great effort==

When students enter [the] society, they will find that the efficiency of work is very crucial. Therefore, they have to realize that they [ought]==should aim== to do things more effectively and develop their own [way]==methods== to improve their efficiency. [The] hard work, however, [would]==will== never be the most important factor.

I believe that grading students solely based on their academic performance is not a fair approach. Students’ efforts should be recognized as well. While I understand Kelly’s perspective about rewarding excellence, it is also important to acknowledge hard work and dedication. In terms of fairness, it is crucial to commend both outstanding academic achievements and consistent effort in order to provide opportunities for as many students as possible. Schools should not be competitive environments where only a select few thrive; rather, they should focus on fostering personal growth and development through learning. I agree with Paul that giving credit for students’ hard work can benefit them later in life during university or job applications. In other words, what truly matters in the long run is an individual’s ongoing commitment to hard work, curiosity, and open-mindedness. Regardless of one’s major or career path, persistent effort is the key driver of substantial progress and tangible accomplishments. Therefore, to sum up, grading should be based on both academic performance and effort.

I totally agree with Kelly’s words that the major environmental problem is the water pollution. Water pollution can directly [effect]==affect== the health of a [great]==large== number of people and the consequences of the pollution, such as infection [illness]==diseases==, are hard to control. In that case, from my [view of point]==point of view==, the government should address the problem immediately. 

There are other [ways which]==methods that== are ==both== effective and affordable. Unlike the Kelly’s [words]==suggestion==, removing salt from seawater definitely is a waste of money. The government should develop and encourage scientist==s== to research the way to purify the polluted water, perhaps through discovering the causes of the pollution and using some chemical processes to eliminate the toxic substances. If they found the [reasons]==sources==, it would benefit thousands of people. Serious diseases and healthy issues would be lessened.

I totally agree with Paul’s words that field trip==s== can significantly benefit students. After all, some students may [find out]==discover== their dream [future] jobs, which is definitely a good thing to [trigger]==motivate== students’ diligence and determination in their future [academical]==academic== performance. Moreover, from my point of view, field trip==s== also can be considered as a opportunity to relax for students. [An ]Outdoor activities can help students cope with [their] stress and get refreshed especially after a long period of study==ing==. Conversely, staying in classroom day after day could affect students’ learning efficiency, ==especially== if they had nothing to do but study. Not only can field trip be a joyful experience, but also students can learn certain knowledge they may never be able to [gain an understanding]==understand== in the classes. [In a word]==In conclusion==, a field trip is advantageous for both the mental health and the innovation of students.

I personally agree with Kelly’s words. After all, [receiving]==securing== a job in an old, ==well-==established and [famous]==prestigious== company means that the person is excellent and distinguish==ed==, because there are a lot of [competitions]==competitors== in one position of those big [company]==companies==. In [additional]==addition==, [famous]==renowned== company also provides valuable experience and rare opportunities for students. Students can [know]==connect with== a great number of intelligent [figures]==professionals== and engage in some important projects, which can broaden ==their== the horizon [of the students]. Moreover, by observing how the [whole]==large== company [work]==operates== benefits students especially who want to set up an organization by themselves. [Conversely]==On the other hand==, taking a position at a new company as the first job after graduation [could be useless]==may not be as advantageous==, [as a result of]==This is because== the members of the company may have less experience and struggle with obscure objective, which is [destructive to improve]==hinder== the efficiency of students’ self-development and [blocks]==obstruct== the way to the brilliant future of them.



#### 15

I personally agree with Paul’s idea. After all, a comfortable environment can cheer the employees up and nobody wants to work in a dark, noisy==,== and dirty place. In addition, from my point of view, a nice [circumstance]==work environment== is always beneficial to the health and help them to avoid [some illness issues]==certain illness== as well. For example, there should be a gym or a cafeteria [where]==that== provides some green, organic food inside the company, [making sure]==ensuring== that people ==who== work [in] there [have chances to eat something healthy]==have access to healthy meals== and [add]==incorporate== regular exercise==不可数== into their routine. In that case, not only are old employees more likely to stay, but also the company can attract [some new people]==new talent== who want to live [in] a health==y== life==style== to work for it. Moreover, I think there should be some plants and flowers [showed]==shown== in the workplace which enables the employees to [keep]==maintain== a positive mood.
