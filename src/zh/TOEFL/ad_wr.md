I personally agree with the Claire==‘s== words. After all, we buy the tech products in order to make our lives more convenien==t==. If the product is useless to our daily needs, purchasing it would be a hug==e== mistake. In addition, it is a waste of money. For instance[s], I buy a phone with a big mobile storage like 1TB, which could cost[s] thousands of dollars, but I rarely use it. In that case, the extra storage [will]==would 条件句中用虚拟语气== be useless. What I mean is, unlike certain small stuff[s] such as a pretty doll or a cute notebook and so forth, you just spend little money on it so it does not matter if you don’t want to play with the doll or write ==in the== dairy on the notebook anymore. You should ensure you really need the function of a tech product before you buy it.

 

I totally agree with Paul’s words. After all, more and more people will choose to take free public transportation for saving money. That can benefit both the people and the environment. People save money [in]==on== buying gas or fuel, and there will be less production of carbon dioxide which is [a kind of green]==greenhouse== gas and lead==s== to the global warming. In addition, [less]==fewer== cars on the street is also convenient for people to commute. [During]==In== the morning, there are always a great number of cars in the center of the large cities, which make people [get late to work or school]==to be late for work or school==. If many people chose the public transportation, especially the [underground]==subway== which does not even drive on the street==s==, the traffic would be [more smooth]==smoother==. That==‘s== a double-win for environment and people [live]==living== in cities.

I totally agree with Kelly’s words. After all, good leaders should understand the daily works of their employees. If the leader just has certain communication skills but doesn’t know how to distribute works to their employees, the work efficiency of the team will be bad. In addition, from my point of view, how to assign works to employees is essential. Only if the leader know that a task requires what kind of knowledge, he or she will assign the task to an employee who is appropriate for the task. The leader who has a great technical background can earn the employees’ respect. If a leader keeps distributing works to someone is not familiar with the knowledge that is required to finish the task, the leader is not going to be a good one.
