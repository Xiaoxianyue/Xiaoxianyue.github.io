## 1. 修饰目的题

### 1.1 举例关系（目的就在举例的正前方）

> 判断标志：for example / for instance / such as

The use of celebrities such as singers and movie stars is common in advertising. The intention is for the positively perceived attributes of the celebrity to be transferred to the advertised product and for the two to become automatically linked in the audience's mind. In children's advertising, the "celebrities" are often animated figures from popular cartoons. In the recent past, the role of celebrities in advertising to children has often been conflated with the concept of host selling. Host selling involves blending advertisements with regular programming in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other. ==Host selling occurs, for example, when a children's show about a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same lion promotes a breakfast cereal==. The psychologist Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of host selling reduced children's ability to distinguish between advertising and program material. It was also found that older children responded more positively to products in host selling advertisements.

In paragraph 4, why does the author mention a show about a cartoon lion in which an advertisement appears featuring the same lion character?

A. To help explain what is meant by the term "host selling” and why it can be misleading to children

B. To explain why the role of celebrities in advertising aimed at children has often been confused with host selling

C. To compare the effectiveness of using animated figures with the effectiveness of using celebrities in advertisements aimed at children

D. To indicate how Kunkel first became interested in studying the effects of host selling on children

选 A

### 1.2 目的可能跟例子隔了一些东西

The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the drought years of the early 1930’s. ==The ensuing rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture, especially from the 1950’s onward, transformed the economy of the region==. More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala. Modern irrigation devices, each capable of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a landscape dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. In addition, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef cattle are fattened here.

In paragraph 3, why does the author provide the information that 40 percent of American cattle are fattened in the High Plains?

A.   To suggest that crop cultivation is not the most important part of the economy of the High Plains

B.   To indicate that not all economic activity in the High Plains is dependent on irrigation

C.   To provide another example of how water from the Ogallala has transformed the economy of the High Plains

D.   To contrast cattle-fattening practices in the High Plains with those used in other regions of the United States

选 C

**A. To suggest that crop cultivation is not the most important part of the economy of the High Plains**

- 这个选项不完全正确。尽管提到肥育牛是该地区的一个重要经济活动，但并没有明确指出作物种植不是最重要的经济部分。作者更多地是在强调水资源对经济的全面影响，而不是否定作物种植的重要性。

**B. To indicate that not all economic activity in the High Plains is dependent on irrigation**

- 这个选项也不完全正确。虽然肥育牛不直接依赖灌溉，但文中并没有明确讨论这一点。作者更多地是在描述灌溉水如何推动农业和其他经济活动，而不是在强调依赖水资源的活动。

**D. To contrast cattle-fattening practices in the High Plains with those used in other regions of the United States**

- 这个选项也是错误的。文中并没有提到与美国其他地区的肥育牛做比较。重点是奥加拉拉水如何促进该地区经济，而不是与其他地区做对比。



### 1.3 A a

Arid（干旱的） lands, surprisingly, contain some of the world’s largest river systems, such as the Murray-Darling in Australia, the Rio Grande in North America, the Indus in Asia, and the Nile in Africa. These rivers and river systems are known as "exogenous" because their sources lie outside the arid zone. They are vital for sustaining life in some of the driest parts of the world. For centuries, the annual floods of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, for example, have brought fertile silts（肥沃的淤泥） and water to the inhabitants of their lower valleys. ==Today, river discharges are increasingly controlled by human intervention, creating a need for international river-basin agreements==. The filling of the Ataturk and other dams in Turkey has drastically reduced flows in the Euphrates, with potentially serious consequences for Syria and Iraq.

In paragraph 2, why does the author mention the Ataturk and other dams in Turkey?

A. To contrast the Euphrates River with other exogenous rivers

B. To illustrate the technological advances in dam building

C. To argue that dams should not be built on the Euphrates River

D. To support the idea that international river-basin agreements are needed

选 D

**为什么选项 C 不正确：**

**C. To argue that dams should not be built on the Euphrates River**
作者并没有明确表示“应该”或“不应该”在幼发拉底河上修建水坝，而是指出水坝建设对下游国家（叙利亚和伊拉克）可能带来的负面影响。因此，选项 C 并没有得到段落的直接支持。
