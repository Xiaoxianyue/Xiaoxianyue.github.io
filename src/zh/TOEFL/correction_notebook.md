这题错选了D，属于==因果关系==没搞清楚；

D的因果关系是，欧洲移民是美国家庭变小的原因，当时只注意了这是个因果关系就选了；

而原句的意思是，由于美国家庭变小，欧洲移民开始在美国各个方面崛起发挥更大的作用了；

所以这里的美国家庭变小是原因，不是结果。选A

![image-20250530114939527](./correction_notebook.assets/image-20250530114939527.png)

单词题，profound意思是深刻的，深远的

intense意思是强烈的，紧张的，热情的，非常的

![image-20250530121012744](./correction_notebook.assets/image-20250530121012744.png)

这题选了B，

原文关键句：

> *It was cold enough for hydrogen compounds in the nebula to condense into solid ices only beyond the frost line... Inside the frost line, only metal and rock could condense...*

翻译成中文：

> 只有在“霜线”以外，氢化合物才冷却得足够形成固态冰；在“霜线”以内，只有金属和岩石能够凝结。

所以我们可以**间接推出**，氢化合物在霜线以内**无法凝结为固体**，也就是说它们仍然是**气体**。

**那为什么不选 B 呢？**

因为选项 B 看似正确（逻辑推断合理），**但原文没有直接支持“氢化合物在霜线以内保持为气体”这个说法**。它只说了 **它们在霜线以内不能凝结为固体**，但没有直接说它们是“以气态存在”的。

这在托福阅读中是一个常见的陷阱：**选项看似合理但是“推断”而非“直接信息”**。

==托福阅读考的是同义替换，文中没有给的信息不要选，即使看似正确==

![image-20250530122111983](./correction_notebook.assets/image-20250530122111983.png)

选了D

没有找到定位句就想当然地选择了。这种Except题，段落都会有明显地语义分层的！下面来研究一下：

定位句：

Although the particles were far too small to attract each other gravitationally at this point, they were able to move together through electrostatic forces-the same static electricity that makes hair stick to a comb.

重力太小了是不利于粒子结合的因素，他们靠 electrostatic forces 结合。

完全把这段话忽略了。可能就没认为这段话是考点

可能是考点的原因：

这里上一句老师问了一句：为啥你喜欢它（长跑）？这是提问考点，要着重注意。并且定位段不断地在车轱辘话来回讲，有可能要掌握他的大致含义，选项会考同义替换。当然，这也属于与主题不相干的内容插了一嘴，但是这里我们还不知道主题是啥，所以这个方法很难预测到考点。

#### Task 02

The students should be allowed to park in the faculty parking lot for two reasons. First, students need to drive around to look for a place because spaces are difficult to find, so they often late to class. Second, the faculty parking lot is not fully used. There is a lot of empty space in there in the morning. In the lecture, the girl disagreed with the idea. First, there is a special parking lot for off-campus students. There is plenty of space and just 10 minutes to walk to the classroom. Second, the faculty parking lot is empty during the early morning because a lot of professors have not arrived at school. But in the middle of the day, the parking lot is full and there is not much empty space.

First, students need to drive around to look for a place because spaces are difficult to find, so they often late to class.

❌ 存在两个小错误：

1. “so they often late to class.”
     应该改成：**so they are often late to class.** （需要加 “are”）
2. “to look for a place”
     稍微有点不够清晰，可以改成：**to look for a parking space**（更具体）

✔️ 改正后：
 **First, students need to drive around to look for a parking space because parking spaces are difficult to find, so they are often late to class.**

#### Task 03

Children are mature enough to control themselves and continue to work toward completing tasks. In the lecture, the professor used his sounds to illustrate the set. The sound tried to stack the tower with wooden blocks, but the tower just fell over. So the professor came over to help his sound, but right away. But every day, the professor will wait a few minutes longer, and day after day, the waiting time continues to increase. So his sound finally tried to stack the tower by himself. And as a result, his sound finally managed to build up a tower without any help. That's the meaning of the concept, frustration tolerance.

son读成sound

#### Task 04

Professor introduced two kinds of animal social groups. The first one has strong bonds among each other. For example, the elephant. When one elephant gets sick or injured, the other elephants will take care of it and nurse it. The second kind of group has relatively simple social interaction, such as fishes. They spend a lot of time together, but they do not interact with each other. For example, some individuals probably do not know and recognize each other. They cannot distinguish one fish from another. They do not know the fishes they live around and surround them.

❌ “among each other” 是多余的，通常直接说 “strong bonds among individuals”。

听力中，没有听出来这句：

nurse it back to health.

form any real attachments with each ot

原文：

In 1760,the Duke of Bridgewater completed the first great canal. It brought coal to Manchester and ultimately to Liverpool. It cost more than ￡250,000 and took 14 years of labor to build, but it repaid the duke and his investors many times over by bringing an uneconomical coal field into production. Not the least of the beneficiaries were the people of Manchester, where the price of coal was halved.

两个错题都是围绕着这一段展开的

<img src="./correction_notebook.assets/image-20250531093247663.png" alt="image-20250531093247663" style="zoom:67%;" />

这题选了C。把 True Except 看错了，应该是三个对的一个错的，看成三个错的一个对的。

A，没说。 It brought coal to Manchester and ultimately to Liverpool.动词是bring 不是originate

B, 是 In 1760,the Duke of Bridgewater completed the first great canal. 这句话的同义替换。

C，是 the Duke of Bridgewater completed the first great canal. 的同义替换。这个啥公爵肯定代表私人啦。

D，是 but it repaid the duke and his investors many times over by bringing an uneconomical coal field into production. 的同义替换。

<img src="./correction_notebook.assets/image-20250531094018549.png" alt="image-20250531094018549" style="zoom:67%;" />

这题选了D。文中只是说 Not the least of the beneficiaries were the people of Manchester, where the price of coal was halved. 曼切斯特的价格对半折了，不是 throughout Britain 也不是 more than half

C选项，当时觉得没有说到profitable，其实是这句话没理解意思：

but it ==repaid== the duke and his investors many times over by bringing an uneconomical coal field into production.

repay的过去式形式repaid，看成rapid了。它偿还了公爵和设计者很多，形象说明了利润很大。

还有economical是经济的意思，ecological是生态的意思！！！

#### 六选三题

Among Britains blessings,water was foremost. Water was its best defense, protecting the island from foreign invasion and making it unnecessary to invest in a costly standing army. Rather, Britain invested heavily in its navy to maintain its commercial preeminence around the globe.The navy protected British interests in times of war and transported British goods in times of peace. Britain's position in the Asian trade made it the leading importer of cottons,ceramics,and teas.Its colonies,especially in North America,not only provided sugar and tobacco but also formed a rich market for British manufactured goods.

But the commercial advantages that water brought were not confined to oceanic trade.Britain was favored by an internal water system that tied inland communities together.Water transport was far cheaper than transporting goods overland.A packhorse could carry 250 pounds of goods on its back but could move 100,000 pounds by walking alongside a river and pulling a barge. Small wonder that river transport was one of the principal interests of merchants and traders. Beginning in the 1760s,private concerns began to invest in the construction of canals, first to move coal from inland locations to major arteries and then to connect the great rivers themselves. Over the next 50 years several hundred miles of canals were built by authority of the Navigation Acts,which allowed for the sale of shares to raise capital (money). In 1760,the Duke of Bridgewater completed the first great canal. It brought coal to Manchester and ultimately to Liverpool. It cost more than ￡250,000 and took 14 years of labor to build, but it repaid the duke and his investors many times over by bringing an uneconomical coal field into production. Not the least of the beneficiaries were the people of Manchester, where the price of coal was halved.

选项B：

<img src="./correction_notebook.assets/image-20250531101230749.png" alt="image-20250531101230749" style="zoom:50%;" />

选成了ACF。

A确实文中有但是是节选内容，总结性不强；

B,先分析选项这句话：

Britain benefited from its navy,which secured its leading commerce around the globe,==/==and from its water system,which connected communities and made transportation of goods more economical.

不是海军保护这个水运系统，看成了海军保护国际贸易和水运系统，而是英国benefited from海军和水利系统，刚好对应上面文章的2,3段落。

#### Task 01

First of all, during the class, students need to organize a lot of things and receive plenty of knowledge. So, typing is a more quick way for students to take their notes rather than writing. It is important for students to take notes efficiently. After class, they need to organize their notes. In the computer, the notes can be easily organized using some special software. But in the notebook, it doesn't work out.

**原文中的问题说明：**

1. **“students need to organize a lot of things and receive plenty of knowledge.”**
    - 这句话语气有点笨拙，"organize a lot of things"太口语化，容易让人疑惑具体指什么。"receive plenty of knowledge"也稍显生硬，建议改成“absorb a significant amount of knowledge”。
2. **“typing is a more quick way”**
    - “more quick”语法错误，应该用“quicker”，或者直接说“a faster way”。
3. **“it doesn't work out”**
    - 这个表达偏口语化，且比较模糊。建议改为“this is not as convenient”或者“this is not feasible”。

First of all, during class, students need to manage a substantial amount of information and absorb a significant amount of knowledge. Therefore, typing is a faster and more efficient way for students to take notes compared to writing by hand. Efficient note-taking is crucial, as it helps students better understand and review the material. After class, students often need to revisit and organize their notes to reinforce their learning. On a computer, notes can be easily categorized, edited, and stored using specialized software, making the review process more convenient and systematic. In contrast, handwritten notes in a notebook can be disorganized and difficult to rearrange, especially when students need to make changes or add additional information. Thus, using a computer for note-taking not only saves time but also enhances the overall learning experience.

#### Task 02

As you may know, the summer student abroad in Peru has been cancelled because of the low enrollment, and students who are interested in Spanish language can have another activity to choose. In The lectured boy has a different idea. First, he points out there are still a few months left until the summer, and the requirement of the summer student abroad activity is very strict. Students should get high grades and at least have three recommendations from their professor. The program should be open to more people and the requirements should be less strict. Second, some students may be interested in Peru's culture and history, and that they cannot experience in Mexico or Spain. 

==choose读得特像choice==

**“the summer student abroad in Peru has been cancelled”**

- 建议改为“the summer study abroad program in Peru has been canceled”，更符合表达习惯。

**“students who are interested in Spanish language can have another activity to choose”**

- 建议改为“students who are interested in Spanish language studies now have an alternative activity to consider”，更自然流畅。

**“and that they cannot experience in Mexico or Spain.”**

- 结构不完整，应该改为“which cannot be fully experienced in Mexico or Spain”。

As you may know, the summer study abroad program in Peru has been canceled due to low enrollment. However, students who are interested in Spanish language studies now ==have an alternative activity to consider==. In the lecture, the boy expresses a different opinion. First, he argues that there are still a few months ==remaining before summer==, and the current ==requirements== for the study abroad program are too strict. Students need to maintain high grades and obtain at least three recommendations from their professors. He believes the program should be more ==accessible==. Second, he points out that some students are particularly interested in Peru’s unique culture and history, ==which cannot be fully experienced in Mexico or Spain==. 

#### Task 03

学表达！！！

读错的：

- effort

听力原文：

```
Now, listen to part of a lecture on this topic from a psychology class. Okay, so researchers did an experiment that demonstrated how this works. They recruited a bunch of volunteers and had everyone look at two different paintings by the same artist. All of these volunteers were people who knew something about art. They had some background or training in art history, but none of them had seen these particular paintings before. Now, the researchers divided the volunteers into two groups, and they showed both groups the same two paintings. One group was told that the first painting had taken the artist several months to paint, while the other painting had taken her only a couple of days. And the researchers told the other group the opposite, that the second painting was the one that had required more effort, that it took much longer to paint than the first one. And then both groups were asked to rate the two paintings, to say which painting they thought would sell for a higher price. Now, of course, there's a lot to consider when you're thinking about how good a painting is, and how much money it could sell for, right? Like, how interesting the subject is, how the artist uses color, the technique. But what happened was kind of interesting, and demonstrates how these mental shortcuts can affect our judgment. You see, most people in the first group, the one that had been told the first painting had taken months to paint, they said that the first painting would sell for a higher price. And then, as you can probably guess, the group that had been told that the second painting had taken longer, they thought the second painting would sell for more. But you can see how this is flawed, right? I mean, these two groups of people couldn't both be right. Explain the effort heuristic, and how it is illustrated in the professor's example of the two paintings.
```

总结：

In the psychology lecture, the professor explains the effort heuristic using an experiment with two paintings. ==Volunteers with some art background were divided into two groups==. Each group was shown the same two paintings by the same artist. ==One group was told the first painting took months while the second took days, and for the other group, this information was reversed.== Both groups then rated which painting would sell for a higher price. Interestingly, the group that believed the first painting took longer rated it as more ==valuable==, and ==the other group did the same with the second painting==.

叽里咕噜说啥呢…先赔我两万

The biology lecture focuses on how scientists study extinct animals' diets using their bones, particularly through two approaches: examining fossilized teeth and bone structure. By analyzing tooth marks or changes, scientists can infer the type of food consumed; for instance, ancient apes' teeth showed scratches indicating a diet of hard foods like seeds, ==contradicting== the soft food diet of modern apes. Additionally, the structure of bones reveals dietary habits. An example given is an extinct bear with powerful jaw bones but thin leg bones, leading scientists to conclude it was a scavenger rather than a hunter, as its leg structure was unsuited for hunting live prey. These methods enable researchers to make accurate assumptions about ancient animals' eating habits.

#### Task 01

Nowadays, some people use extreme methods, including surgery, to change their appearance-usually because they are trying to look more attractive in some way. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why you agree or disagree with people using such methods to change how they look. Support your opinion with details.

1. 有害健康——健康更重要
2. 不够自信——内在——不然空虚

I think it is a bad idea for people to use extreme methods, including surgery, to change their appearance. First of all, such surgeries can be really harmful to one's health and may lead to serious complications. From my point of view, a healthy body is far more valuable than just having a pretty face. Second, people who choose to undergo these surgeries often lack self-confidence. The real solution to this problem is to cultivate inner qualities. No matter how pretty a person appears on the outside, they will still feel empty rather than truly at peace inside.

#### Task 02*

The campus tours is not allowed to enter the library, because with the tour passing through the library, the students can be distracted, and there are going to be a video tour on the university website for the tour to experience the view of the library. In the lecture, the boy has a different idea. First, she mentions that the building is very beautiful and online video cannot bring the tourists into the atmosphere of the library. In fact, he is one of the students that was attracted by the beauty of the library. Second, there is a way to address the noise question. The tour guide should make sure all the tours should be quiet and no more questions and talking during the way of the library.

- tourist 不是 tours

- 又he变成she了哈

You know, the CAPTOR is not allowed to enter the library because the tour passing through the library might distract the students. Also, there will be a video tour on the university website to allow tourists to ==experience the library virtually==. In the lecture, the boy has a different idea. First, he mentions that the building is very beautiful and that an online video cannot truly ==capture the atmosphere of the library==. In fact, ==he himself== was attracted to the university because of the library’s beauty. Second, he suggests that the noise issue can be addressed by ==having the tour guide ensure that all tours remain quiet== and that visitors refrain from asking questions or talking ==while in the library==.



#### Task 03

- dull 没听出来

We know that dimorphism refers to the difference within one same species. In a lecture, the professor used an example about paradisal birds to illustrate the concept. The male birds have large feathers with bright colors because they need to draw the female's attention. But the female bird has smaller feathers with brown color, such as green or brown. The reason that the male birds have bright colors is because they need to attract a lot of mates. The reason of the color of the female birds is because they need to take care of their young. So the brown color helps them to mix with the surrounding, making them unnoticeable to some dangerous predators.

#### Task 04

The professor introduced two ways to keep the employees happy. The first way is mentoring. That means new employees can ask help for older employees to handle their issues. In that case, the new employee will not feel frustrated. For example, the professor working as a university mentor at first, she said it is comfortable and make them stay at the university to ask questions, to ask older employees some questions. And second is about controlling, letting the employee control their choice and hour of their work. The employee has different responsibilities. For example, they need to take care of small children.

#### Task 01

First, it is very convenient for me and my family and friends who live in a very distant place from my IMEI. I can chat with them on the apps such as WeChat and Instagram. Second, the social media allows us to give opportunities to make a variety of friends. Everyone has their own value and personality. We can engage with various standpoints, which help us to think critically.

这句话说的很不流利：

It is very convenient for me to contact my families and friends who live far away from me.

Social media gives us chances to make various friends.

1. 在不同的app上交到不同的朋友——与他们交谈，可以开阔视野
2. 用手机聊天更方便——可以在工作学习的间隙保持联系——线下见面太费时间

I completely agree with that statement. First, social media enables us to make many different friends through various platforms and apps. Talking with them helps expose us to different perspectives and broaden our horizons. Meanwhile, our critical thinking skills can also be improved. Second, people can chat with their friends ==during short breaks from work or study==. On the other hand, by comparison, meeting in person is very time-consuming. For example, people need to do a lot of preparation before meeting, such as making plans or restaurant reservations. They may seem small, but when they add up, they can take hours to complete.

#### Task 02

Now the university is going to open a device repairing center to solve problems for students. Electricity is diverse, and volunteers will help them learn the process, learn something during the process. Also, it can be cut down the waste on electronic devices. In the lecture, the girl agrees with the idea. He mentioned that once his phone cannot charge, he found that just a little dust avoid the phone to be charged. So with the repair center, the student can know what to do. And the problem must be very small, such as a broken screen. Second, she pointed out that her roommate just threw away his electronic device to the trash. With the repair center, it can be fixed.

问题：阅读没读好，忙着抄标题。标题以后==抄个名词就好了==

两点原因只许记1~2处笔记，记多了说不完！

听力cord没听懂，好吧不怪你。以后没听到的画个圈，整理的时候着重组一下句。

丢掉坏电器，坏没说哈，语法错误更是一坨。“to the trash” 应简化为“in the trash”。

such a center could change the ==current throwaway culture==, highlighted by her roommate discarding multiple devices in a year.

#### Task 03

The first consensus is that students will think they are similar to the other people surrounding them. In the lecture, the professor used an experiment to illustrate the concept. The student was asked if they want to do something like this, something that sounds embarrassing, such as talk loudly at a quiet library. Some of the students are willing to do this, but others refuse to do such things. So all the students who ask the second question, what do they think, whether other students are willing to do such embarrassing things. Interestingly, the students are willing to do those things, and others are willing to do those things, too. And the students refuse to do those embarrassing things, and others are not willing to do those embarrassing things. So they cannot be all correct.

==思路一，两个问题的结果可以整合在一起说==。

==-ed又没注意！！！请把大大的ed写旁边==。。

Obviously, they cannot all be correct.

#### Task 04

I will first introduce two effects that urban environment will affect plant growth. The first way is the warmer temperature. In the city, the temperature is often higher than the countryside. So there is a longer growing season for the plants to grow. For example, the trees in the city are 25% larger than the trees which are the same type and age as them in the countryside. The second effect is there is less soil in the city. So the seed has the adaption to spread out and burst easily. For example, a flowering plant has a heavy seed. The heavy seeds are not likely to be blown off by wind and can be streaked into the soil and burst out.

- “the temperature is often higher than the countryside”需要补充“the temperature in the countryside”。

- “which are the same type and age as them”可以更简洁自然地表达为“of the same type and age”。

- blow过去式blown

### 写作 112

From my point of view, those money-management classes are significantly for students. First of all, it is an essential skill to help students manage their money. I have seen people who do not save money cannot face certain unexpected situation. For instance, one of my friends changed her job suddenly and the new office was far away from her home. Since she did not own a car and have no extra money to buy one, she had to squeeze in subway every morning and spent hours commuting. The classes in high school should cultivate the realization of students to save and manage their money. Second, students especially teenagers do not take their parents' words seriously. In that case, teaching them valuable skills in classes can be more attractive to them. This kind of class is more relaxing compared to chemistry or math classes, which means students will more likely be interested in them.

- 原句 "those money-management classes are significantly for students" 不符合地道表达，应当说 "are very important for students" 或者 "are highly beneficial for students"。==这里打完 significantly 忘记加形容词了==
- money做存款的意思时候，可以换成finances
- 面对困难：==often struggle when facing unexpected situations==
- 上班地点：workplace

- Since she did not own a car and have no extra money to buy one, she had to squeeze in subway every morning and spent hours commuting.这句话，主谓一致 "did not own" 和 "had no extra money"；=="squeeze in subway" 改为 "squeeze into the subway"==；"spent" 改为 "spend" 因为与 "had to" 平行。
- ==cultivate awareness of the importance of==

- In that case, teaching them valuable skills in classes can be more attractive to them.这句话，用 =="In this context" 替换 "In that case" 以避免重复==；补充 "financial skills" 更具体；=="more attractive" 改为 "more engaging" 更正式==。

- students will more likely be interested in them. 大姐你在咋想，==be more likely to== 固定搭配哈，，

#### Task 01

1. I prefer the latter one.
2. First, the air pollution in the city is already very serious, so a community garden can help to turn the situation better and make sure people in the city can breathe some fresh air.
3. Second, some of the people want to do some outdoor activities, but they do not have time to go out of the city, so this kind of park gives them a place to appreciate the good land view and do some outdoor sports.

==improve the situation==

=="some of the people" → “some people” 更自然。==

==landscape说成land view啦==

==participate in outdoor sports，such as frisbee==

==leave the city== 

扩展：

The area is covered with **dense vegetation**.

“改善健康状况”可以用以下几种表达： ✅ **improve health**✅ **enhance health**

第二点加一个在工作学习的间隙，逻辑更通畅

#### Task 02

**原句：**
 ❌ From the reading window, there should be a sign-up system for students of labs computers for students to reverse one-hour computer time in advance.

**分析：**

1. **From the reading window** 这个短语用法不对，语义不清（reading window 并没有解释或上下文）。应该是“According to the reading passage”或者“Based on the reading”。
2. **students of labs computers** 语序混乱，应该是“students of the lab’s computers”或者更自然地说“students who use the lab’s computers”。
3. **reverse one-hour computer time** 这里“reverse”拼写错了，应该是“reserve”。
4. 句子整体冗长，逻辑混乱。

**修改建议：**
 ✅ **According to the reading passage, there should be a sign-up system for students to reserve one hour of computer time in the lab in advance.**



**原句：**
 ❌ In that case, this system can improve the efficiency and reduce the noise from the waiting people.

**分析：**

1. **improve the efficiency** 这里的“the”显得累赘，一般用“improve efficiency”更自然。
2. **from the waiting people** 不太自然，应该是“caused by people waiting”。

**修改建议：**
 ✅ **In that case, this system could improve efficiency and reduce noise caused by people waiting.**



**原句：**
 ❌ First, the student cannot complete their test within one hour.

**分析：**

1. 这里“the student”用得不自然，应该泛指“students”。
2. **their test** 不够清晰，可以说“their tests”或者“his/her test”（不过一般倾向于用“students”加“their tests”）。

**修改建议：**
 ✅ **First, she argues that students might not be able to complete their tests within just one hour.**



**原句：**
 ❌ Imagine that if they work, they will be interrupted.

**分析：**

1. 句子结构比较口语化，也有点模糊。
2. **Imagine that if...** 太啰嗦，直接写“if”条件句就好。

**修改建议：**
 ✅ **She points out that if students are working and their time is up, they will be forced to leave.**



**原句：**
 ❌ So the student will come back later to the lab, which can be less efficient for their work.

**分析：**

1. 同样，应该用复数“students”。
2. **which can be less efficient for their work** 语气不太流畅，可以更自然地写成“which could be inefficient for their workflow”。

**修改建议：**
 ✅ As a result, students would have to return to the lab later, which could be inefficient for their workflow



**原句：**
 ❌ For example, some students may argue that who should entitle the computer and things like that.

**分析：**

1. **argue that who should entitle the computer** 语法错误：
    - **that who** 错误，直接用“over who should get the computer”。
    - **entitle the computer** 用法错误，“entitle”不是“占用电脑”的意思，应该用“get the computer”或者“use the computer”。

**修改建议：**

✅ **For example, some students might argue over who should get the computer, leading to disputes.**

#### Task 03

说的太乱了！！

整理信息不够精简；刚开始意思就是教授要女儿对所有礼物都表现出开心，不只是娃娃dolls

当看到祖母送的衣物，开始有点失望，经过父母提醒，拥抱谢谢了祖母。

==一定要用中文过一遍逻辑意思！！！==

==自己整理逻辑，不要照搬听力材料的，说不完的！==

范文：

The professor uses his daughter Ella's birthday experience to explain display rules—societal codes that dictate how we should express emotions. To prevent potential discomfort at Ella's party, her parents taught her to ==show appreciation== for all gifts, anticipating she might not receive ==her preferred dolls==. When Ella opened clothes from her grandmother, ==showing initial disappointment==, her parents quickly showcased the clothes positively. ==Inspired by their guidance==, Ella hugged her grandmother and thanked her, displaying a ==socially appropriate response== instead of her true feelings. This incident highlights how children are taught display rules to manage their reactions to fit social expectations, aiding in maintaining harmonious interactions.

#### Task 04

In the last lecture, the professor introduced two ways the birds keep their young safe. The first kind of way is using the location. They will build the birds with some natural barrier. For example, the magpie will build their nest into the trees and brush. The strong of the trees and brush will prevent the nest from some predators, such as cats, to get through it. Second, they will hide their nest. For example, a kind of bird called African homebird will build their nest inside of some hollow trees. So they will close the open of the tree with mud until it's small enough. And just allow the male birds to get in. In that case, the predator will not know there is a nest inside of the tree.

**the birds keep** → “birds”是泛指，不用加“the”。

**two ways the birds keep** → “two ways that birds keep…”或“two ways in which birds keep…”更完整自然。

**with some natural barrier** → 可以更明确，比如“near natural barriers”或“within natural barriers”。

**a kind of bird called African homebird** → 建议改为“a type of bird called the African homebird”。

**inside of some hollow trees** → “inside some hollow trees”更简洁。

From my point of view, more new kinds of courses should be taught in high school. In the first place, high school teach various basic knowledge to students, but few of them are good at all kind of subjects. For example, some students are not good at math but have an incredible talent on literary. High school students have definitely realized what aspects they are interested in. To motivate students, they should have ability to avoid studying subjects they do not like. In that case, students have less basic classed and have opportunities to access new knowledge. Second, with the rapid pace of modern society, plenty of industry pay more attention to the practice ability of employees. For instance, programmer need to spend a large amount of time repeating to practice coding. If coding or computer was taught in high school, students can start to prepare for their career earlier.

- ❌ *"students have less basic classed"*
     ✅ **修改**：*"students have fewer basic classes"*

     （“talent”后面用“in”+学科。）
