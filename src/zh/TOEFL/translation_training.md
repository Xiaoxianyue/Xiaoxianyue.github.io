## 10.15 —— 96

### 1.中文

一生中有不少值得庆祝的重要事件。每当此类特殊场合来临时，人们会制定出很多计划。举办生日或毕业派对是很有趣的。对于这些有意义的聚会的规模（人们有不同看法），有些人喜欢组织多人参加的大型派对，而有的人则更偏向举行小型家庭聚会。我认为，无论这些个人事件有多么重要，聚会应该越简单越好。

第一，组织大型派对会浪费过多的钱财与精力，而且众口难调。在聚会开始之前，主人需要处理很多琐事，包括发送邀请函、选择宽阔场地、购买大量食材、装饰场地以及准备活动与节目。所有这些必定要付出昂贵的代价，而且很耗费时间。宾客抵达的时候，情况会更加棘手。主人需要招待所有人，并同时负责烹饪、餐桌等。派对结束后，还得继续辛苦地做清理工作。

第二，每个人都应该对自己的私生活保持低调。完全没有必要让一大群人参与到这些私事之中。对于大多数普通百姓来说，生日庆祝和毕业派对并非旨在维系名人公众形象的社交和商业场合。这些特殊场合应该注重简约。邀请很多客人还会让人感觉主人过于自大。过分强调公众形象的人不易被自己的群体所接受。

其实，人生大事应该与最亲近的人一起庆祝，包括家人和密友。的确，具有纪念意义的时刻理应是无拘无束、舒适且无他人干扰的。在生日或毕业时，来自亲人的真诚祝福是个人收到的最珍贵的礼物。与他们一起共进美餐并自由地交谈，这些虽然看起来很平凡，却能带来值得永久珍惜的巨大幸福与美好回忆。

在我看来，为诸如生日或毕业之类的事情费工夫组织大型聚会庆祝的确毫无必要。这些有纪念意义的时刻应该与亲人共度，而不应过于公开化。尽管让很多宾客到来看起来是个不错的主意，但对于大多数普通人来说，举行简单的聚会通常是更佳选择。

### 2. 第一段 自他翻译对照

#### 2.1自翻

There are plenties of important events which should be celebrated in our lives. When it is coming to the particular situation which people often made many plans for. Organizing a birthday party or a graduation party is pretty funny. About the 规模 of those meaningful parties(people have different opinions), some people like to celebrate in a big party with a lot of people while other prefer to small family parties. In my perspective, no matter how important the personal incidents are, the gathering should be as simple as it can be.





#### 2.2 他翻

There are many important events in life that deserve to be celebrated. Whenever such special occasions arise,people will have a lot of plans to make. Holding a birthday or graduation party could be fun. Regarding the scale of these meaningful get-togethers,  some people are in favor of organizing larger parties with many people being invited. Other people, however, would rather hold smaller ones with in the family. I think it is a good idea to keep these personal events as simple as possible no matter how significant they may be.



#### 2.3 不地道表达纠错

- 每当此类特殊场合来临时：

    自：When it is coming to the particular situation

    他：Whenever such special occasions arise

    - 显然，这里的场合（生日，毕业，升娃等等）用 occasion （场合，时机，机会）比 situation合适的多

    - arise（出现，产生，发生）也更加生动形象

- 举办生日或毕业派对是有趣的

    自：Organizing … partied could be fun

    他：Holding … is pretty fun

    - 举行派对这种非正式活动，用 hold 更加地道。
    - could be 这样的表达更加顺滑。

- 对于这些有意义的聚会的规模

    - 规模：scale
    - 非正式聚会：get-togethers

- 而有的人则更偏向举行小型家庭聚会

    自：others prefer to small family parties

    他：Other people, however, would rather hold smaller ones with in the family

    - would rather 宁愿；宁可 —— 固定表达。

- 无论这些个人事件有多么重要，聚会应该越简单越好

    自： no matter how important the personal incidents are, the gathering should be as simple as it can be.

    他： it is a good idea to keep these personal events as simple as possible no matter how significant they may be.

    - as simple as possible 比 as simple as it can be 更地道
    - 不是 incident ！这个更多是“意外”的意思。





#### 2.4 自翻语法错误

**"When it is coming to the particular situation which people often made many plans for."**

- 错误：时态和结构问题。这里的时态应该是“when it comes to”，而不是“when it is coming to”。另外，"which people often made many plans for" 中的“made”用的是过去时，应该改为一般现在时“make”，因为描述的是一个普遍事实。
- 修正：`When it comes to particular situations that people often make plans for.`

**"Organizing a birthday party or a graduation party is pretty funny."**

- 错误：“funny”用词不当。在这个上下文中，应该用“fun”而不是“funny”。“Funny”意味着“好笑的”或“滑稽的”，而这里应表示“有趣的”。
- 修正：`Organizing a birthday party or a graduation party is pretty fun.`

**"About the 规模 of those meaningful parties(people have different opinions),"**

- 错误：中英文混杂使用，“规模”没有翻译为英文。此外，句子结构不自然，可以简化。
- 修正：`Regarding the scale of these meaningful parties (opinions differ among people),`

**"while other prefer to small family parties."**

- 错误：“other”应该是“others”，并且“prefer to”结构错误，应该是“prefer small family parties”，不需要“to”。
- 修正：`while others prefer small family parties.`

**"no matter how important the personal incidents are"**

- 错误：“incidents”一般指的是不好的事件（如事故等），这里应使用“events”更为恰当。
- 修正：`no matter how important the personal events are`



### 3. 第二段

#### 3.1 自翻

Firstly, organizing big parties will waste too many money and energy, by the way, it is hard to satisfy people’s various need. Before the party starts, the holder need to handle a lot of things, including sending the invitation letter*（就是 invitations 就可以了）*, choosing a wide place of the party, purchasing thousands of food ingredients, decorating the place and preparing the activities and shows. All of this thing must be paid expensively（直接就是 expensive ！又被直译迷惑了！） and time consuming. When the guests arrive, the situation would turn to be more complex. The master need to take care（entertain） of everyone, and to cook, to put the table（等这个字没翻译！） at the meantime. When the part ends, they have to do the cleaning work hardly.

#### 3.2 他翻

In the first place, organizing a large party might be a waste of money and take too much energy. What's more, it is **exceptionally**  difficult to satisfy everyone. Before the parties held, the host has to address many detailed matters,including **sending out** invitations, selecting a large space, purchasing **huge quantities of** food, **decorating** the venue and preparing activities or performances. All these will definitely prove both expensive and time consuming. The situation could be challenging with many guests arriving. The host will need to entertain all of them **whilst** he is also in charge of the cooking, **setting the table** and all the other tasks. After the party the hard work continues as the host cleans up the **mess**.



#### 3.3 不地道表达纠错

- 主人：host
- 设法处理，解决：address
- 发送：send out （固定搭配）
- 大量：huge quantities of
- 聚集地点；会场：venue

- 宾客抵达的时候，情况会更加棘手。

    自：When the guests arrive, the situation would turn to be more complex. 

    他：The situation could be challenging with many guests arriving.

- 同时：whilst

- 招待：entertain

- 负责：in charge of

- 布置餐桌：set the table（不是 put the table ，太土了！）

- 还得继续辛苦地做清理工作。

    他：After the party the hard work continues as the host cleans up the **mess**.
