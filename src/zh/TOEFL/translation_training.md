## **96**．A big party with many people or a small party just with family?

### 1.中文

一生中有不少值得庆祝的重要事件。每当此类特殊场合来临时，人们会制定出很多计划。举办生日或毕业派对是很有趣的。对于这些有意义的聚会的规模（人们有不同看法），有些人喜欢组织多人参加的大型派对，而有的人则更偏向举行小型家庭聚会。我认为，无论这些个人事件有多么重要，聚会应该越简单越好。

第一，组织大型派对会浪费过多的钱财与精力，而且众口难调。在聚会开始之前，主人需要处理很多琐事，包括发送邀请函、选择宽阔场地、购买大量食材、装饰场地以及准备活动与节目。所有这些必定要付出昂贵的代价，而且很耗费时间。宾客抵达的时候，情况会更加棘手。主人需要招待所有人，并同时负责烹饪、餐桌等。派对结束后，还得继续辛苦地做清理工作。

第二，每个人都应该对自己的私生活保持低调。完全没有必要让一大群人参与到这些私事之中。对于大多数普通百姓来说，生日庆祝和毕业派对并非旨在维系名人公众形象的社交和商业场合。这些特殊场合应该注重简约。邀请很多客人还会让人感觉主人过于自大。过分强调公众形象的人不易被自己的群体所接受。

其实，人生大事应该与最亲近的人一起庆祝，包括家人和密友。的确，具有纪念意义的时刻理应是无拘无束、舒适且无他人干扰的。在生日或毕业时，来自亲人的真诚祝福是个人收到的最珍贵的礼物。与他们一起共进美餐并自由地交谈，这些虽然看起来很平凡，却能带来值得永久珍惜的巨大幸福与美好回忆。

在我看来，为诸如生日或毕业之类的事情费工夫组织大型聚会庆祝的确毫无必要。这些有纪念意义的时刻应该与亲人共度，而不应过于公开化。尽管让很多宾客到来看起来是个不错的主意，但对于大多数普通人来说，举行简单的聚会通常是更佳选择。

### 2. 第一段 自他翻译对照

#### 2.1自翻

There are plenties of important events which should be celebrated in our lives. When it is coming to the particular situation which people often made many plans for. Organizing a birthday party or a graduation party is pretty funny. About the 规模 of those meaningful parties(people have different opinions), some people like to celebrate in a big party with a lot of people while other prefer to small family parties. In my perspective, no matter how important the personal incidents are, the gathering should be as simple as it can be.





#### 2.2 他翻

There are many important events in life that deserve to be celebrated. Whenever such special occasions arise,people will have a lot of plans to make. Holding a birthday or graduation party could be fun. Regarding the scale of these meaningful get-togethers,  some people are in favor of organizing larger parties with many people being invited. Other people, however, would rather hold smaller ones with in the family. I think it is a good idea to keep these personal events as simple as possible no matter how significant they may be.



#### 2.3 不地道表达纠错

- 每当此类特殊场合来临时：

    自：When it is coming to the particular situation

    他：Whenever such special occasions arise

    - 显然，这里的场合（生日，毕业，升娃等等）用 occasion （场合，时机，机会）比 situation合适的多

    - arise（出现，产生，发生）也更加生动形象

- 举办生日或毕业派对是有趣的

    自：Organizing … partied could be fun

    他：Holding … is pretty fun

    - 举行派对这种非正式活动，用 hold 更加地道。
    - could be 这样的表达更加顺滑。

- 对于这些有意义的聚会的规模

    - 规模：scale
    - 非正式聚会：get-togethers

- 而有的人则更偏向举行小型家庭聚会

    自：others prefer to small family parties

    他：Other people, however, would rather hold smaller ones with in the family

    - would rather 宁愿；宁可 —— 固定表达。

- 无论这些个人事件有多么重要，聚会应该越简单越好

    自： no matter how important the personal incidents are, the gathering should be as simple as it can be.

    他： it is a good idea to keep these personal events as simple as possible no matter how significant they may be.

    - as simple as possible 比 as simple as it can be 更地道
    - 不是 incident ！这个更多是“意外”的意思。





#### 2.4 自翻语法错误

**"When it is coming to the particular situation which people often made many plans for."**

- 错误：时态和结构问题。这里的时态应该是“when it comes to”，而不是“when it is coming to”。另外，"which people often made many plans for" 中的“made”用的是过去时，应该改为一般现在时“make”，因为描述的是一个普遍事实。
- 修正：`When it comes to particular situations that people often make plans for.`

**"Organizing a birthday party or a graduation party is pretty funny."**

- 错误：“funny”用词不当。在这个上下文中，应该用“fun”而不是“funny”。“Funny”意味着“好笑的”或“滑稽的”，而这里应表示“有趣的”。
- 修正：`Organizing a birthday party or a graduation party is pretty fun.`

**"About the 规模 of those meaningful parties(people have different opinions),"**

- 错误：中英文混杂使用，“规模”没有翻译为英文。此外，句子结构不自然，可以简化。
- 修正：`Regarding the scale of these meaningful parties (opinions differ among people),`

**"while other prefer to small family parties."**

- 错误：“other”应该是“others”，并且“prefer to”结构错误，应该是“prefer small family parties”，不需要“to”。
- 修正：`while others prefer small family parties.`

**"no matter how important the personal incidents are"**

- 错误：“incidents”一般指的是不好的事件（如事故等），这里应使用“events”更为恰当。
- 修正：`no matter how important the personal events are`



### 3. 第二段

#### 3.1 自翻

Firstly, organizing big parties will waste too many money and energy, by the way, it is hard to satisfy people’s various need. Before the party starts, the holder need to handle a lot of things, including sending the invitation letter*（就是 invitations 就可以了）*, choosing a wide place of the party, purchasing thousands of food ingredients, decorating the place and preparing the activities and shows. All of this thing must be paid expensively（直接就是 expensive ！又被直译迷惑了！） and time consuming. When the guests arrive, the situation would turn to be more complex. The master need to take care（entertain） of everyone, and to cook, to put the table（等这个字没翻译！） at the meantime. When the part ends, they have to do the cleaning work hardly.

#### 3.2 他翻

In the first place, organizing a large party might be a waste of money and take too much energy. What's more, it is **exceptionally**  difficult to satisfy everyone. Before the parties held, the host has to address many detailed matters,including **sending out** invitations, selecting a large space, purchasing **huge quantities of** food, **decorating** the venue and preparing activities or performances. All these will definitely prove both expensive and time consuming. The situation could be challenging with many guests arriving. The host will need to entertain all of them **whilst** he is also in charge of the cooking, **setting the table** and all the other tasks. After the party the hard work continues as the host cleans up the **mess**.



#### 3.3 不地道表达纠错

- 主人：host
- 设法处理，解决：address
- 发送：send out （固定搭配）
- 大量：huge quantities of
- 聚集地点；会场：venue

- 宾客抵达的时候，情况会更加棘手。

    自：When the guests arrive, the situation would turn to be more complex. 

    他：The situation could be challenging with many guests arriving.

- 同时：whilst

- 招待：entertain

- 负责：in charge of

- 布置餐桌：set the table（不是 put the table ，太土了！）

- 还得继续辛苦地做清理工作。

    他：After the party the hard work continues as the host cleans up the **mess**.

Inviting too many guests may make the host to be looked (过于自大). The people who (过分强调) public (形象) are not easy to be (接纳) by their own group.



#### 4.2 他翻

In the second place, everyone ought to remain modest in his private life. It is absolutely unnecessary to have a large number of people join in these personal events. For most ordinary people, birthday celebrations and graduation parties are not social and commercial occasions which mostly aim at **keeping up** a celebrity's public image. These special occasions ought to be spent in a simple manner. Inviting a crowd of people may give others the impression that the person **attaches too much importance to** himself. Those who overemphasize their importance in public might not be well accepted by the **community**.

#### 5.2 他翻

Actually, major events in one's life should be celebrated with the closest people, including the family and intimate friends. Indeed, this memorable time is destined to be **carefree** and comfortable, without interference from others. On birthdays or graduation days, the sincere wishes from loved ones are the most precious gifts one could receive.

### 6. 第五段

#### 6.1 自翻

In my opinion, it is meaningless to spend our energy in organizing big parties to celebrate things like birthday or graduation. Those memorable moments should be experience with families, but not to be over-public. Although having a lot of guests arrived seems like a great idea, but for most ordinary people, holding simple parties usually is the better choice.



#### 6.2 他翻

In my opinion, there is definitely no need to **take the** **trouble to** organize a big party to celebrate such events as birthdays or a graduation.

## 62．Is university education the most important factor in a person's success?

### 1. 中文

在大学里度过的那几年宝贵的时光值得终生珍藏，这是人们普遍认同的。毋庸置疑，高等教育是通往辉煌成功漫漫路途中至关重要的阶段。然而，获得大学学位仅仅代表学业初有成果，以及性格刚刚开始成熟。因此，我更愿意认为大学教育仅仅是通向成功的基石，而不是最重要的因素。

首先，我们不能否认高等教育对个人发展的重要。这是一段特殊的时期，在此之后，年轻人就将踏入社会并最终使自己成为合格且有责任感的社会成员了。因此，所有在这座象牙塔里积累的知识、技能以及宝贵生活经验将对一个人未来为成功的拼搏产生深远影响。具体来说，大学教育与初级教育不同，初级教育的重点大都在课本里的最基础理论之上，而大学教育则提供给学生更多将所学知识应用于实践的机会，并且引导其实事求是。导师允许学生进行独立的思考，并且给予他们更多抒发自己个人见解的自由。最终，由于具备了在大学中掌握的专业技能，毕业生会在最终踏入崭新人生阶段时更有信心。

然而，认为大学教育是个人成功最重要的因素就未免过于绝对了。其他关键的因素也应得到重视。世界上有很多名人虽然并没有大学学位，却获得了惊人的成功。其中，全球首富比尔·盖茨应当成为我们关注的焦点。他在1973年进入哈佛大学，然而却在2年后退学并创办了微软公司。微软以其操作系统占领了个人电脑市场并在信息技术行业掀起了浪潮。他辉煌的成功与很多内在素质有很大关系，包括智慧、坚强的意志、自信、创新力以及最重要的一点，那就是不懈的努力。不言而喻，这些重要的品质是每位成功人才都必备的。

的确，教育是可持续一生的进程，每个阶段都有其独特的意义。一个人的教育从呱呱坠地之时开始。父母可视为给孩子提供启蒙教育的首位老师。之后，在幼儿和小学接受正规的教育，此时老师帮助孩子们理解常识，并且指引他们学习最基础的理论。当一个人到了上中学的年龄时，就可以获得更丰富的知识，掌握更多的技能。毋庸置疑，初级教育为迎接崭新的大学生活做了准备。即便大学毕业之后，教育依然在工作岗位上继续进行。正如一句格言所述，“活到老，学到老。”因此，不仅大学教育，其他阶段的教育也同样是使一个人成功的重要因素。

总之，能够有机会接受高等教育为人生注入了无穷的快乐，如此有意义的经历也为将来的成功铺平了道路。然而，如果忽视了其他因素的话，获得大学文凭对于达到目标是远远不够的。一个人只有通过坚持不懈的努力以及大学毕业后继续保持的学习意志才能最终收获成功。
