## TPO 30 P1

### 3. 细节题

Colonization is one way in which plants can change the ecology of a site. Colonization is a process with two components: invasion and survival. The rate at which a site is colonized by plants depends on both the rate at which individual organisms (seeds, spores, immature or mature individuals) arrive at the site and their success at becoming established and surviving. Success in colonization depends to a great extent on there being a site available for colonization—a safe site where disturbance by fire or by cutting down of trees has either removed competing species or reduced levels of competition and other negative interactions to a level at which the invading species can become established. For a given rate of invasion, colonization of a moist, fertile site is likely to be much more rapid than that of a dry, infertile site because of poor survival on the latter. A fertile, **plowed field** is rapidly invaded by a large variety of weeds, whereas a neighboring **construction site** from which the soil has been compacted or removed to expose a coarse, infertile parent material may remain virtually free of vegetation for many months or even years despite receiving the same input of seeds as the plowed field.



Why does the author mention a ‘plowed field’ and a ‘construction site’ in the passage?

- A. To argue that sites that have been affected by human activity tend to be colonized slowly
- B. To illustrate the kind of sites that may be invaded by weeds
- C. To contrast sites in terms of their suitability for colonization
- D. To explain that exposing or compacting the soil results in successful colonization

**选 C**

- 参考解析

    用plowed field and a construction site先定位细节出处整段最后一句话，==**那么这个细节所支撑的目的句要么在它前1.2句，要么就是整段的主旨句了。**==很明显，其所突出的目的句就是前一句话，结合这两句话来进行选择：For a given rate of invasion, colonization of a moist, fertile site is likely to be much more rapid than that of a dry, infertile site because of poor survival on the latter.这句话的内容只要是说，入侵肥沃的土地比那些干涸的、不肥沃的土地要来的快很多。这就和C选项呼应



### 6. 推断题

If colonizers produce short-lived reproductive propagules, then they must produce very large numbers unless they have an efficient means of dispersal to suitable new habitats. Many plants depend on wind for dispersal and produce abundant quantities of small, relatively short-lived seeds to compensate for the fact that wind is not always a reliable means of reaching the appropriate type of habitat. Alternative strategies have evolved in some plants, such as those that produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to suitable sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long-lived seeds. Many forest plants seem to exhibit the latter adaptation, and viable seeds of pioneer species can be found in large numbers on some forest floors. For example, as many as 1,125 viable seeds per square meter were found in a 100-year-old Douglas fir/western hemlock forest in coastal British Columbia. Nearly all the seeds that had germinated from this seed bank were from pioneer species. The rapid colonization of such sites after disturbance is undoubtedly in part a reflection of the large seed bank on the forest floor.

What can be inferred from paragraph 3 about the reason that large seeds are dispersed by birds or small animals rather than by the wind?

- A. Large seeds are easier for birds and animals to see than are the small seeds dispersed by the wind.
- B. Large seeds are too heavy for the wind to disperse.
- C. Large seeds cannot be eaten by birds and animals.
- D. Large seeds are short-lived and thus require a more efficient means of dispersal than small seeds do.

选B。

重点：找定位句

==用large seeds可定位到原文第3句，但是，第三句不足以用来推测，还需结合讨论seed传播方式的第二句话，==这两句话将小种子和大种子传播方式做了介绍：Many plants depend on wind for dispersal and produce abundant quantities of small, relatively short-lived seeds to compensate for the fact that wind is not always a reliable means of reaching the appropriate type of habitat. Alternative strategies have evolved in some plants, such as those that produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to suitable sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long-lived seeds.这两句话的主要内容是：小种子通常靠风传播, 大种子由鸟和动物实现传播。而在说道风这个传播媒介是，提到它的特性是not reliable的。后面就接着说大种子依赖其他的途径传播，言下之意就是大种子太重了，风很难传播。那么就和B选项的内容呼应。

@tab 自己理解

前面说小而寿命短的种子靠风传播 not always a reliable means of reaching the appropriate type of habitat. 后面相当于提出两个解决办法：生产大种子给鸟传播或者生产寿命长的种子。为什么要强调生产大的种子？推断——太重了。





### 7. 指代题



The phrase “the latter adaptation” in the passage refers to

- A. producing fewer seeds
- B. producing larger seeds
- C. dispersal by birds or small mammals
- D. producing long-lived seeds

**选 D**

这题中心是要考定位。一般定位到前一句或者前几句。

- 定位句：

    Alternative strategies have evolved in some plants, such as those that produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to suitable sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long-lived seeds.

- 参考解析：

    the latter adaptation, 后一种适应性, 因为是定冠词the修饰的，就代表在前文有所提及。而前一句话中就在讨论alternative strategies中有两种方式，一就是：生产少一点，但是个头更大的种子，可以被鸟类或其他小的哺乳动物传播到合适的地方；第二种就是生产段落开头讲的是短命种long-lived seeds, 所以后一种适应性是指长命种子。和D选项对应。
