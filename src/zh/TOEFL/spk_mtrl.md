## 1. Off 总结

### 33 现在比过去更容易吃到健康的食品吗

麦当当：

Now that fast food is everywhere, I can' t help myself from going into those restaurants that serve fried chicken, burgers and pizza. When I don' t know what to eat for lunch, I would reach for McDonald' s next to my school. I have to admit that they' re really tasty.

自己在家做饭健康：

However, in the past, there weren't this many choices. Most people who earn a regular salary would cook at home, and it' s usually healthier—at least the food wouldn't be so greasy, and there would be more vegetables rather than meat.



### 34 私家车应该被禁止吗

inconvenient

transportation crowed

Public transportation cannot reach

交通不方便的例子：

For example, if emergencies happen and we need to drive someone to the hospital, or if some day I' m almost late for work and don' t have enough time to take public transportation.



### 37 和善的老师

more strategy to deal with

effective feedback

keep an eye on 

conflicts and argument

在老师课上认真听讲：

kind teachers will gain students’ love and respect. Just as the old saying goes: “Love me, love my dog.” Students will be more willing to listen to the teachers they like in class.



### 38 小说还是非小说有趣？

get freshen up and energy can be recharged full again

Second reason is reading fictions can help students to learn some useful narrative techniques. For example students can learn the method of flashbacks and use it in their own creation



### 39 演讲 or 报告？

help me learn more knowledge than just prepare a speech. To … I need to research a lot and carefully organize my paper.

语料取自那一篇 最好学知识的方法是教别人吗



### 40 电子书还是纸质书

The first reason and also the most important one I wanna say is that, **printed materials like books and newspapers actually are a kind of culture throughout the whole world which represents the wisdom of our ancestors**. What’s more, although electronic devices are convenient nowadays, **the screen of it is bad for our eyes, we should never stare it for too long. And it’ll have radiation too**. So **for the sake of our health**, that’s why I insist that the printed materials will always be popular.

wisdom culture electronic 

### 41 用钱放电影或者专注于学术

facus on their major study and won’t be distracted by those entertainment.

hold up some lectures

Help them easy up and remain a better mood. So it’s a good way to balance their study and life. 



### 32 给钱让孩子做家务

motivate / save money

form a good habits / chances to learn skills

I was pretty excited about the fact that I do **own a certain amount of money and learned to save it for different things: whether I would use it to make small purchases or save the money in bank.**



### 30 家长决定孩子工作

 employment rate

 Second, kids should learn to make decisions by themselves. Take my experience for example, when I was young, my parents always made decisions for me. But later when **I went to school in another city and started to live on my own, I felt so helpless and confused.** I didn’t know how to make any decisions by myself.



## 2. 例题总结

### 2.1 举例子型

#### 2.1.1 休闲玩乐

I favor department stores more than those small specialty stores. One reason is that anything I want can be purchased from large grocery stores, s**o it is an ideal place for me to buy dresses, tops, shorts, bags and shoes at the same time.** Another reason is that **other entertainment facilities can also be offered by large grocery stores**. When I get bored and tired, my parents or friends can **go to café or restaurant and treat ourselves with a movie afterwards.**



#### 2.1.2 没时间读书？

I believe that people in the future will read fewer books than they do in the present. One obvious reason is that the **rapid pace of life allows less time for employees to immerse themselves in a wide range of books**. Another reason is that **various entertainments such as video games, soap operas and outdoor activities will distract people from focusing on studying**, even when they are in library. 



#### 2.1.3 学习教育

Well, I totally agree that the best way to improve a skill is by teaching others. Because first, before teaching others certain skills, we need to be well-prepare for the teaching. **For example, I need to do research on the internet, read academic journals, or even do mock teaching in front of mirror** before demonstrating the knowledge to other people. In that case, I could have a better understanding of what I am going to teach. 



#### 2.1.4 父母出主意？

For example, **when it comes to choosing a school, they will know what factors to consider like location, ranking, tuition,** and stuff like that.

In addition, parents are more **resourceful than people of my age.** Like if I **want to apply for a job**, my parents may know someone who is working there, and they may introduce that person to me. In that case, I can get more information: **like working environment, how to prepare for the job interview and the company culture.**



#### 2.1.5 在不同地方生活

Well, I prefer to move around and live in many different places because I think it's gonna be more fun. I mean I **get to explore a variety of places and experience different lifestyles and try exotic foods I never tried before**.

In addition, I think moving around and living in different cities would also allow me to become more independent. Like when I go to a new place, **I'll have to learn to do a lot of stuff by myself like finding an apartment, getting it furnished and even putting together furniture following the instruction manual**. And all these would definitely help me to become more independent so that I won't feel panic even though I have to move again.



#### 2.1.6 老师的工作

The main reason is that professors are already super busy. **They have to prepare handouts for the classes, stay after class to answer students’ questions and also grade students’ assignments. So, they don’t have the time and patience to keep an eye on the students.**

### 2.2 学习教育类

#### 2.2.1 互帮互助

Firstly, it can create a supportive environment and help with their study. When students are studying the same subject, t**hey can motivate and challenge each other to achieve academic success.** For example, if two psychology students are roommates, **they can help each other out with difficult assignments and study for exams. This can lead to better grades and let them have a deeper understanding of the course materials.**



Plus, through the teaching process, the other person **may point out some different viewpoints or even mistakes I make during the short lesson. Those are things that I could not realize if I keep working on things alone.** Therefore, both the teachers and the learners can get accurate knowledge.



#### 2.2.2 交朋友

Besides, I think it is also easier to make friends with a roommate who is studying the same subject. **I mean, by attending the same classes, it's more likely for them to get along well with each other. This can help students feel connected to their academic community, which is definitely a good thing.**



#### 2.2.3 体育锻炼对学习的好处

Well, from my perspective, exercising regularly does play an important role in students’ academic performance. First, it helps students **increase their energy level as well as their learning efficiency because it is a great way to ease pressure.** If **students maintain physically ac  tive by doing sports daily, like football and frisbee, they can stay motivated and focused.** This way, it is easier for them to achieve academic success. Also, **doing exercise on a regular basis can help students form some good habits**. Students **will be more self-disciplined once doing exercise is added into their daily routine**. In that case, **students can learn how to stick to their learning goals as well**.



#### 2.2.4 社区活动?专心学习

That’s because students will only take something which is beneficial for their academic work seriously. If university forces students to volunteer in the community, it gonna make students **see it as a chore, a nuisance**, so **they are not gonna put their hearts into it**, and make them **have more negative feelings about it**, which is gonna make the university look bad. Plus, university students already **have a lot things on their plates**. Focusing on their schoolwork helps them **get better grades and achieve academic success.** Therefore, I think it'll be better for them to focus on their **major study, projects and researches** which are meaningful for them, you know, **to make every minute count**.



#### 2.2.5 争议性演说家？

College students **are mature enough to get viewpoints and opinions from all aspects.** For example, if the guest speaker has some thoughts **towards political issues or economical aspects**, then the critical thinking skill of students could be developed at the same time.



#### 2.2.6 上不同的专业课

To start with, it enables them to **broaden their horizons**. For example, **if an English major chooses to take a Geography course at the same time, he or she can be a project manager working for an environmental organization instead of just being an English teacher**.



#### 2.2.7 课间休息可以干嘛

That's because during the classes, **I usually learn a lot of things, you know, taking notes in a hurry. Therefore, I need a little time to organize my notes and process all the knowledge.** Also, it is very important for me to take a short break like **going to the bathroom, grabbing some snacks and drinking water.** Plus, taking this short break can help me better prepare for the next class **such as cleaning up the table and taking the textbooks out for the next class.** However, if I just have a long break when classes are all over, I may **end up getting exhausted**, so it will make my study less efficient.



#### 2.2.8 自学还是听讲座

The main reason is that this **facilitates my learning process**. When I was a graduate student, although I’d do some pre-class reading, **I still found it hard to understand the abstract contents**. Yet during the lecture, **the professor would explain the theories in a more learner-friendly way, like citing examples and using educational games to help with our understanding**. And **whenever questions popped up, I could exchange ideas with other students in the class, which would definitely help me gain a better understanding of the course materials**. Instead, if I choose to learn something by reading textbooks, I think I may easily get bored. **I may end up learning nothing and it’s gonna be a total waste of my time**.



#### 2.2.9 师生关系

Besides, **supervising students too closely would also damage the relationship between students and professors. Students will think their teachers don’t trust them and there is gonna be a lot of conflicts and arguments between them. This will lead to resentment and sometimes even outright rebellion.**



#### 2.2.10 学生参与讨论

That is because firstly, it can turn students into active learners. **When they're doing this, they can actually start to think, they will brainstorm and they gonna write down their ideas on the notebook, and all those things they do can help students learn better, improve their study efficiency. Once their ideas are proved to be correct or you know, useful, it will give students a sense of achievement. Besides, it is also a way for teachers to get effective feedbacks from students about how students absorb the knowledge and whether they have any problems. It is the reflection of teachers’ teaching, also the teachers will know whether they elaborate the points.**



### 2.3 生活类

#### 2.3.1 通勤时听音乐？

The first reason is because music can help me cope with my stress. I am a big fan of pop music, so every time when I put on my headphone and listen to pop songs, **I could feel like being in another world that helps me get refreshed especially after a long day of studying**. Another reason is that doing nothing on public transportations is kind of like a waste of time. What I mean is I usually spend more than an hour commuting everyday. Therefore, music is a great time-killer for me.



#### 2.3.2 该不该让老年人运动

Well, I personally don’t think it is a wise choice to let old people take risk and participate in adventurous events. The first reason is that doing challenging events like rock climbing or skydiving is likely to **cause them health issues. What I mean is old people usually have diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and so on. Doing those extreme sports might trigger more severe illness.** Moreover, adventurous events are usually not **as affordable as** some daily sports activities like running or swimming. **Doing activities like this might cause them hundreds of dollars, because they need to get equipment, find a coach to get professional training and so forth. For those who only receive a limited amount of pension, it would definitely add more pressure to their financial burden.**



#### 2.3.3 该不该记历史事件信息？

Historical events in many parts of the world are usually intertwined, and remembering the time they happened enables us to view them together rather than treating them as isolated cases. If students can create a timeline of the events, and also know about what caused it and what happened after the event, students can better understand the effects and nuances of history.



#### 2.3.4 白天兼职影响学习

Because most universities do not offer evening classes or regular classes on the weekends. So a parttime job during the day can hardly fit into their hectic class schedules. **If students do not complete the degree requirement by the expected deadline, they have to delay their graduation, which is definitely a bad thing**. 

Also, I think **the most important thing for college students is to do well academically**, but after working for like six or eight hours per day, many students are pretty wiped out. Some of them may find it hard to focus on their classes in the evenings, and **this will negatively affect their overall academic performance**.



#### 2.3.5 住农村还是城市

Firstly, living in the countryside means we can **appreciate the healthier environment**. Nowadays, people living in city have to **suffer the air and water pollution caused by the high speeding development of industry**. Secondly, we can enjoy the slow pace of life in the countryside. In big cities, pedestrians are always walking fast and it seems like they would feel unwilling to stop. But with the easy life style of countryside, they don’t have to **deal with the high pressure resulted from working and living.**
